"2016-05-24 12:02","POLITICO's Morning Transportation: Lawmakers aim to defend WMATA in House T&amp;I hearing â€” Thune puts the brakes on McCaulâ€™s calls for quick TSA action â€” Airports say â€˜No thanks!â€™ to Katkoâ€™s push for security funding flexibility","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from heather caygle jennifer scholtes annie snider and isaac arnsdorfcoming to wmata s defense congress is holding another wmata focused hearing on the hill today this one is hosted by the house t amp i highways and transit subcommittee and don t be surprised if it s another public flogging i think there ll be some grandstanding for sure said rep john delaney del eleanor holmes norton said she expected to witness members spanking wmata but here s one thing that s different from that epic guns blazing house oversight hearing from last month this time members of congress will also be testifying including delaney rep gerry connolly and rep steny hoyer their goal to offer a defense of sorts for the changes that have been put into motion since the metro subway system started setting deadlines for safety failures and general dysfunction changing the conversation delaney talked to mt on monday night about his goals for the hearing we ve gotta figure out how to change the debate here to be a little more constructive with doing some positive things to improve the system as opposed to just railing on them delaney said i m sure there ll be a bunch of intense criticisms but hopefully we ll have a slightly better dialogue norton agreed about the dmv delegation s aims they will be trying to find ways to bolster wmata given what the new gm has done norton said the federal government is the missing actor here i don t think that the region is in a position yet to say give us some money but there s no way in which you can take wmata and essentially build it from the ground up without some funds somewhere she also said she wants to glean some answers from the fta about whether recent measures put in place to monitor wmata s finances have proven too onerous gird their collective loins as for the other folks on the stand including wmata general manager paul wiedefeld and fta acting administrator carolyn flowers they ll have one mission do better than last time norton said she talked to flowers on monday to prepare her for the meeting and give her a heads up on what to expect flowers bore much of the brunt of members ire at the hearing last month especially when she acknowledged that fta staff did not participate in inspections during metro s emergency safety shutdown instead offering that the agency kept tabs on the inspections by making a few phone calls fwiw flowers was not in charge of the agency at the time of the shutdown she knows what she s doing she s a competent person but there was some dissatisfaction with her testimony norton said look i talked to her today and i told her you better get ready for some more questions the burden is on her now it s tuesday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains planes automobiles and ports today in transportation awwwwww dog rescued after living on highway median for five weeks from usa today h t ed from dot reach out mpowers politico com or martinepowers it s starting it s over you re burned out and older we re living out the back of the car h t ben khouri of sen richard burr s office security shakeup tsa administrator peter neffenger informed staff on monday that he s removing kelly hoggan from his post as assistant administrator for the office of security operations according to the new york times hoggan had been in the job since and had become increasingly mired in accusations that he had punished whistle blowers and dealt himself under the radar bonuses deputy assistant administrator darby lajoye will be his temporary replacement the announcement came just as messages have grown more vehement from members of congress especially sen mark kirk r ill calling for administrative resignations if the agency doesn t start to curb airport security wait lines soon mccaul pushes for tsa action house homeland security chairman mike mccaul says he s planning to introduce a bill later this week to push further advancements to security at airports and airlines a move that comes even as he asks the senate to pass two tsa related bills previously approved by the house the tsa precheck expansion act and the transportation security administration reform and improvement act of not gonna happen thune says but senate commerce chairman john thune says there s no chance the senate will take up those two bills in an expedited process especially as his staff pointed out on twitter last week many of the provisions included in those bills were included in the senate s faa reauthorization bill i don t think it s as easy as just calling them up and clearing them over here he said today there were people who were not in favor for various reasons of those bills if we tried to hotline them i m not convinced that we would get unanimous consent he s gotta keep the carrots as our heather caygle explains thune said moving the bills individually could also stifle momentum for his faa bill everybody wants us to strip pieces of our bill out and move them independently i ve had like four or five requests from members who have individual bills but the problem with that is then you start losing momentum for the legislation he said we ve got a bill that includes those things at the house ready for action that addresses those and a whole bunch of other things that we think need to be addressed impatiently waiting as for the faa bill thune is starting to get palpably antsy to see some action from the house he said he spoke to house t amp i chairman bill shuster last week for an update they re still i think going to try and socialize his idea on atc reform and see if they can win over enough people over there to move their bill i just conveyed that i don t want to do a short term extension that doesn t solve any problems thune said adding that he s trying to be accommodating but is also beginning to worry about timing every week that goes by around here you get increasingly concerned that we re not making forward progress thune continued and my understanding is over there at the leadership level too they want to give him some running room to try and see if he can persuade folks i just want to make sure that we re acting in sufficient time so that we don t run up against it and ending up having to do another extension which i m fearful is where we re headed if we wait too long the right to pay in the continued angst over airport security wait times rep john katko is seeking to give airports the ability to pay for tsa overtime costs but that s a right that airports have no interest in availing themselves of our jennifer scholtes talked to kevin burke president and ceo of the airports council international north america most have groaned he said about the news that katko was pursuing the legislation why put the burden back on the airport we didn t create the problem we re opposed to this jen explains more of the reasons behind airports collective side eye although katko s office has not responded to inquiries about whether he plans to drop that part of his proposal airport and airline leaders say they ve heard as much burke and his industry counterparts explain that airports are particularly opposed to the idea because congress is still siphoning money from the passenger security fee that s tacked onto airplane tickets while travelers pay up to per trip to cover screening costs congress has been diverting of that total to deficit reduction n j lawmakers laud tsa action new jersey s congressional delegation gave a thumbs up to tsa on monday after the agency deployed additional agents to newark liberty international airport and informed the lawmakers that they plan to hire new agents by june and bring on passenger screening canine teams we have demanded assurances from tsa that it will provide sufficient resources and increased staffing to reduce these long waits sen robert menendez said it s my hope that we can stop the insanity foxx hires wmata adviser transportation secretary anthony foxx has picked dot general counsel kathryn thomson to be a special adviser for wmata oversight according to the washington post she starts in her new role this week the timing was such that while katie thomson was stepping down from the general counsel position she still wanted to serve foxx told the post getting the washington metropolitan area transit authority turned around is critical to public safety and we are so fortunate that katie has agreed to assist our efforts for a few months state dots hold out hope for house in debate over rescissions as the thud appropriations process continues with today s markup of the house version of the funding package state dots are wringing their hands over the prospect of seeing their fast act investment packages whittled away and their best efforts to stop it haven t proven very successful so far the backstory the fast act rescinds billion of contract authority in and the senate s current thud bill takes away an additional billion in the same time period some federal highway transportation programs are exempt from these rescissions which means that the revoked funding comes from a smaller pot of money that heavily affects state dots in a letter earlier this month a trio of groups representing state governments outlined their fears requiring the rescissions to come from only a portion of the unobligated contract authority balances means that programs important to state dots will bear the brunt of these cuts and those cuts will have to be made uniformly across all applicable programs a blunt knife approach that ignores states funding priorities reflected in the balance they wrote this is not a simple and harmless budgetary maneuver conflict to come the rescissions are not in the house thud appropriations bill and the groups are gearing up to push lawmakers to eliminate the rescissions during conference committee based on our latest estimate the combined effect of rescissions in senate approps and the fast act will completely gut the balance of contract authority that state dots carry by said joung lee of the american association of state highway and transportation officials this will translate to actual cuts on highway funding for states below the amounts promised under the fast act wrda fights brewing over port spending harbor and ports interests got a big win in the wrda bill when lawmakers and appropriators agreed on a path for ramping up spending from the harbor maintenance trust fund which is funded from a tax on goods shipped through u s ports and intended to fund ports projects but which has long been diverted to offset other spending now in the house wrda bill that will be marked up wednesday overseers are seeking to convert that deal to mandatory spending in years it s a move that s drawing praise from ports interests although they say the bill leaves out other important aspects of the deal and groans from budget hawks who call the delay a gimmick to prevent the change from ballooning the bill s price tag but the real question is what appropriators will make of it ryan pans clinton s stance on uber in the latest off message podcast with politico s glenn thrush house speaker paul ryan went after democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton for what he thinks is her brand of liberal cronyism citing her stance on ride share companies as a litmus test for her feelings about regulation i think she s also so old fashioned in that i think she i think you know railing against uber against new economic innovations is just telling us she s projecting i am going to regulate the heck out of this economy and i m going to give the keys to the castle to the current kings so that they can pull the drawbridge up behind them ryan told glenn and i think that s the

mate until july that hasnâ t stopped speculation on who the presumptive republican presidential nominee will select for his unconventional ticket former house speaker newt gingrich whoâ s been talked about as among those trump is considering said sunday he wouldnâ t give â an automatic yesâ if approached but suggested he would be interested â if he can convince callista and me that itâ s doable and that itâ s serious and that we would in fact contribute i think weâ d be very hard pressed not to say yes â gingrich said on â fox news sunday â referring to his wife wall street journal andrew ackermanformer house speaker newt gingrich said he could be â luredâ into running as donald trumpâ s vice president though the presumptive republican nominee would first have to get the ex congressmanâ s wife on board â if he can convince callista and me that itâ s doable and itâ s serious and that we would in fact contribute i think weâ d be very hard pressed not to say â yes â â mr gingrich said on â fox news sunday â for mr trump his running mate choice could be the most important signal that he is seeking to unify the gop as the fractured party works to coalesce around its unorthodox candidate mr gingrich has been one of mr trumpâ s most prominent supporters â i donâ t think itâ s an automatic yes â mr gingrich said â i think you have to think through what does he think the job involves â washington post ben terrisben carson the neurosurgeon turned presidential candidate turned unfiltered pitchman for donald trump and now part of the presumptive nomineeâ s vice presidential search committee sat in the back of a town car with his wife candy on his way to a televised interview he had just explained to the reporter riding along that he wanted no role in a trump administration when news arrived of a new poll naming him as the best liked of a list of potential running mates â who else was on the list â he asked quietly maintaining his usual inscrutable calm the most favorably regarded contenders after himself he was told were john kasich marco rubio ted cruz sarah palin and chris christie â those are all people on our list â he said â well not you â candy reminded him sharply reuters ginger gibson and david lawdera top aide to donald trump said on sunday he did not believe the republican presidential front runner posed as his own spokesman to brag about his personal life a controversy that came as democrats sharpen their attacks on the billionaire s character the washington post released an audio recording on friday of a man who identified himself as trump publicist john miller and talked about the real estate tycoon s romantic encounters in a conversation with a people magazine reporter after listening to the tape while appearing on cnn s state of the union show senior trump adviser paul manafort said he did not believe it was the republican candidate s voice despite his past admissions of sometimes using a pseudonym politico jules johnsonrepublican likely presidential nominee donald trump said on sunday that brexit would not have an impact on trade between the u s and britain â if he was in the white house of course speaking to itvâ s piers morgan trump said that he had â big investmentsâ in the u k but added that he had â no preferenceâ on the outcome of the june referendum on britainâ s future in or outside of the european union he added that he intends to â treat everybody fairly but it wouldnâ t make any difference to me whether they were in the eu or not â â i think if i were from britain i would probably not want it iâ d want to go back to a different system â he said in the interview which will air monday on morganâ s breakfast show the hill rebecca savranskyivana trump said it s difficult for her children to be out on the trail campaigning for their father so often â itâ s very hard for them because they all have families â ivana trump told page six at the fashion institute of technology gala â donald jr has five kids and a wife and he has to be on the trail ivanka has three kids she just gave the birth to another baby and eric has a wife she said itâ s very very stressful for them because they have to follow and support him â trump s kids ivanka donald jr and eric often join presumptive gop nominee donald trump on the trail to campaign for their father wall street journal greg ipdonald trump would slash taxes by trillions of dollars leave entitlements alone boost spending on infrastructure and defense and claims an advisor deliver a budget surplus of trillion to trillion there is no credible way to reconcile these claims mr trumpâ s proposals will if enacted dramatically raise the debt not decrease it much less produce a surplus politically though it doesnâ t appear to matter as mr trump understands well voters care a lot less than wonks and journalists do about policy details mr trump and bernie sanders hillary clintonâ s competitor for the democratic nomination are riding high not because of their policies but because they arenâ t the establishment this affords both men extraordinary freedom to make more extravagant promises than their more arithmetically deferential rivals it also enables mr trump to change those positions at will to neutralize his rivalsâ lines of attack in others this would be called flip flopping or prevarication to mr trumpâ s supporters itâ s candor â he talks before he thinks â one supporter said â so he doesnâ t have time to think up something and lie to you â politico isaac arnsdorf and kenneth p vogelas donald trump rushes to start collecting the billion expected to be necessary to compete for the white house one of his biggest challenges may come from those claiming to support him an increasing number of unauthorized groups are invoking the presumptive gop nomineeâ s name to raise money suggesting that theyâ ll use the cash to support his campaign even as some appear to be spending most of their money on contracts with favored consultants trumpâ s campaign and its allies worry that the groups are doing little to help the campaign and may be doing more harm than good by siphoning off cash that would otherwise go to the campaignâ s fledgling fundraising effort the campaign has disavowed several of the groups demanding they stop using the candidateâ s name in fundraising appeals and calling at least one super pac founded by a trump adviser a â big league scam â but appeals keep coming from other groups with more now joining the scrum and rival groups accusing one other of being scams legal changes and technological developments have paved the way for an explosion of political non profit groups including super pacs which have rushed to raise money with very little oversight about how they spend it leading to charges and counter charges of profiteering politico katie glueckrepublicans had thought that after eight years of rancor between the obama administration and the israeli government would be the year american jews began to abandon the democratic party but the conservatives who worked for years to win over jewish voters now say donald trump is driving them away â without question i think there were probably more jews willing to jump over to the republican aisle precisely because of the iran deal and the republican partyâ s staunch opposition to it â said noam neusner a former speechwriter for george w bush who also served as a bush white house jewish liaison and worked for jeb bush â but i donâ t think the opportunity exists anymore largely because trump is just anathema to many jews including jewish conservatives â it wasnâ t supposed to be like this in while nearly every campaign cycle sees largely unfounded speculation that the republican party is poised to pick up more jewish votes over the last four years poll numbers gave republicans reason to believe that more jewish voters were poised to join their ranks new york times charles m blowit has been somewhat fascinating and sometimes fun to watch elizabeth warren do battle with donald trump in alternating salvos of tweets but in the end i fear that this approach of trying to â beat a bully â as warren put it in one of her tweets is a futile effort there is no way to sufficiently sully a pig or mock a clown the effort only draws one further onto the opponentâ s turf and away from oneâ s own principles and priorities there is no way to shame a man who lacks conscience or to embarrass an embarrassment trump is smart enough to know what he lacks â substance â and to know what he possesses in abundance â insolence so long as he steers clear of his own weakness and draws others in to the brier patch that is his comfort he wins as msnbcâ s chris matthews said in december this is asymmetric warfare conventional forms of political fighting wonâ t work on this man truth holds little power and the media is still enthralled by the monster it made new york times francis x clinesas a cocktail waitress for years in this cityâ s xanadu of a casino industry valerie mcmorris learned the hard way that donald trumpâ s art of the deal too often proved to be the art of bankruptcy â iâ ve been through three bankruptcies with mr trump â she said recalling how the fast years of gambling growth here degenerated into a crushing excess of casinos she watched as mr trump hurried to remove â trumpâ from the facades of suddenly failing casinos lest they undermine his claims to financial invincibility the self branding mania that has helped mr trump earn his victory as the presumed republican candidate for president has not worked here ms mcmorris a union representative for unite here local of the cityâ s casino workers is fascinated by how his political winning streak plays out just beyond a battered atlantic city a destination once identified with mr trump that serves now as a reality check his name has disappeared from three casinos one of which has closed across the city casino workers have lost pensions and health care in bankruptcy proceedings and four of casinos closed in recent years with thousands of jobs lost home foreclosures are multiplying and the city has suffered such a precipitous loss in revenue that the state is threatening a takeover new york times patrick healydonald j trump plans to throw bill clintonâ s infidelities in hillary clintonâ s face on live television during the presidential debates this fall questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved mr trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the american consulate in benghazi libya and for the death of ambassador j christopher stevens there and he intends to portray mrs clinton as fundamentally corrupt invoking everything from her cattle futures trades in the late s to the federal investigation into her email practices as secretary of state drawing on psychological warfare tactics that mr trump used to defeat â lyinâ tedâ cruz â little marcoâ rubio and â low energyâ jeb bush in the republican primaries the trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the clintons to try to increase their negative poll ratings and bait them into making political mistakes according to interviews with mr trump and his advisers washington post matea goldleading republicans are increasingly anxious that presumptive gop presidential nominee donald trump is lagging far behind democratic front runner hillary clinton when it comes to having an organized network of big money allies triggering a chaotic scramble to set up a clear super pac structure because trump condemned such entities throughout the primary contest there is no dominant group ready to channel the resources of the billionaires lining up to back him including casino magnate sheldon adelson who has signaled plans to inject tens of millions into the race that leaves trump advisers gop strategists and major donors puzzling over a key strategic question where should the six and seven figure contributions go clintonâ s allies have built a deeply funded constellation of independent groups and her main super pac is readying a million ad blitz that will kick off just weeks from now the fundraising imbalance is acute the top three super pacs supporting clinton had collected about million through the end of march compared with just million by several potential republican presidential players including american crossroads according to federal election commission filings new york times bryce covertdonald j trump has promised to make america great again and people have listened he is the presumptive republican nominee he got there with that one consistent campaign imperative splashed across his website on loud red baseball caps on stickers yard signs and other slogan ready paraphernalia this is the one true unwavering message mr trump offers his supporters he may avoid direct answers on his taxes but he has never backtracked on the need to return the country to its previous glory which america is he promising to us if you ask his supporters they say life has gotten worse for people like them over the last years it seems safe to assume that in the eyes of mr trumpâ s overwhelmingly white male fans america was greater a half century ago indeed it was pretty great â for them itâ s not just that factory jobs were more plentiful or that women and minorities were largely kept from positions of power large national programs that radically changed the country kept america great specifically for white men new deal era systems like social security and unemployment insurance rules that demarcated minimum wages and maximum work hours and protected unionization and the g i bill at the end of world war ii substantially transformed the country and created a booming middle class but they all purposefully left out most women and minorities politico nick gassif donald trump becomes the president of the united states the country s long standing special relationship with the united kingdom could sour if the presumptive republican nominee s statements in an interview with british television are a reliable indication during an interview with media ally piers morgan on itv s good morning britain aired monday trump responded to comments from prime minister david cameron who called his proposal to temporarily ban all muslims from the united states divisive stupid and wrong well number one iâ m not stupid ok i can tell you that right now trump said just the opposite number two in terms of divisive i donâ t think iâ m a divisive person iâ m a unifier unlike our president now iâ m a unifier morgan broached the possibility of trump and cameron both leading their respective countries â looks like weâ re not going to have a very good relationship who knows trump said before quickly adding i hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like heâ s not willing to address the problem either â as for the recent comments by london mayor sadiq khan who said he hoped trump loses the general election trump appeared personally offended editorials op edsusa today the editorial boardwhatâ s donald trump hiding by refusing to release his tax returns the way every major party nominee has done for the past four decades that the presumed republican nominee is not as wealthy as he claims that he uses aggressive tax avoidance schemes that he doesn t give much cash to charity whatever the reasons trumpâ s constantly changing positions about his returns â gonna release them can t release them want to release them might release them â raise suspicions that heâ s concealing something on friday he went so far as to tell abc s good morning america that his tax rates are none of your business well actually they are because americans have the right to know whether someone who wants to lead the nation pays what he owes is free of financial conflicts of interest and gives generously to worthy causes wall street journal editorial boardthese columns warned republican voters that democrats and the media would make an issue of donald trumpâ s tax returnsâ after he was the gopâ s presumptive nomineeâ and that didnâ t take long this week hillary clinton began what is likely to be a campaign from here to november to claim the businessman must be hiding something mr trump is helping the democrats with his changing answers and obfuscation in january the candidate said â i have everything all approved and very beautifulâ and he hoped to release his returns â over the next three four months â he later said he couldnâ t release his returns until the irs finished auditing him though the irs says an audit is no barrier to public disclosure asked this week by the associated press when that day would come mr trump said he didnâ t plan to release them after all after mrs clinton and mitt romney criticized that statement mr trump fell back on the irs audit excuse then on friday on abcâ s â good morning america â mr trump said he didnâ t think voters had any right to see his tax returns and that his tax rate is â none of your business â usa today editorial boardgive hillary clinton credit for chutzpah clinton is demanding that donald trump disclose his tax returns even as she refuses to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches to goldman sachs and other wall street bankers clinton has it half right trump the presumed republican nominee for president should release income returns just as clinton did months ago in her campaign for the democratic nomination because transparency ought to be the norm for anyone seeking the highest office in the land in clinton s case full disclosure should include letting the public know what she said to the bankers â especially because she has repeatedly promised to â rein in wall streetâ if she is elected president new york times the editorial boardthe opioid epidemic is now a leading cause of death in the united states ravaging communities across the country at last congress has snapped to attention but its recent flurry of legislation will be of little help unless lawmakers are willing to fund treatment and prevention programs the house last week passed bills related to opioids and the senate approved a comprehensive bill in march the bills which will be reconciled in a conference committee are overdue opioids a category of drugs that includes heroin and prescription painkillers like oxycodone killed more than people in and the rate of overdoses has tripled since according to the centers for disease control and prevention almost two million americans abused or were dependent on these drugs in the question now is whether congress will appropriate enough money to address the scale of the problem democrats are seeking million and president obama has asked for billion republican leaders have not said how much they would be willing to spend but insist that the total be offset by reductions in other programs or increases in revenue the country is facing a health emergency and it would be tragic if a self imposed budget rule got in the way of a robust federal response "

"2016-05-25 07:21","Trump campaign rift gets personal","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," trump campaign rift gets personalby kenneth p vogel and ben schreckinger am edtthe internal struggle for control of donald trump s presidential campaign is getting personal with allies of feuding campaign manager corey lewandowski and chairman paul manafort increasingly turning to shadowy tactics to try to sully their rivals the battle which was already toxic even by the standards of notoriously vicious internecine presidential campaign spats escalated last week even as trump moved to clarify the official hierarchy atop his campaign by creating a new position campaign chairman and chief strategist for manafort lewandowski s enemies around the campaign after months of circulating rumors about his personal life had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a new york tabloid according a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to be and lewandowski s rivals also circulated a news report about him shopping a book in an effort to raise questions about his commitment to trump s campaign according to people familiar with the incident lewandowski denied the report lewandowski s supporters in turn have urged trump and his representatives to examine manafort s personal life as well as the lobbying done by manafort and his associates according to people on both sides of the lewandowski manafort rift perhaps fittingly much of the feud has played out on the same social media battleground and using the same conspiratorial tone that trump himself has exploited to great effect to belittle his rivals but the tug of war also has potentially serious implications for the presumptive gop nominee s general election matchup with likely democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton many individuals familiar with the trump campaign including campaign staffers and people who work with them on the outside say the infighting has infected the campaign s day to day operations with little communication and mounting distrust among manafort lewandowski and their allies it s a total cage fight in there now said an operative close to the campaign manafort tried to take out corey but he didn t succeed and now everywhere corey looks he sees a threat so he s trying to neutralize those threats supporters and opponents of lewandowski say he and his allies have called trump s attention to articles chronicling lobbying work done by manafort or his campaign associates for a gambling company as well as politically problematic foreign clients including saudi arabia multiple pro russian figures and a group accused of being a front for pakistani intelligence an ally of manafort s said lewandowski takes all the bad news up to trump paul represented this person paul represented that person lewandowski and manafort declined to comment as did the trump campaign s press office but even as a tuesday news report revealed that trump was separating the rival factions into distant office spaces in his new york headquarters a campaign official disputed the characterization of an increasingly bitter and damaging divide asserting that the once skeletal campaign of the billionaire real estate developer had moved past the well documented acrimony in its upper ranks corey and paul are actually working very well together right now there is a very clear delineation of roles and responsibilities right now and things are better than they have ever been the official said suggesting that any efforts to undermine manafort or lewandowski reflected only the actions of lower level individuals acting on their own indeed most of the dirty work on both sides of the tug of war has been conducted not by the principals but by their supporters in and around the campaign for instance a california republican close to the campaign said lewandowski has repeatedly tried to enlist allies on the campaign in his efforts to marginalize manafort he s going to people and saying i need your help we need to get rid of paul said the republican lewandowski s supporters inside the campaign have highlighted accounts of manafort privately assuring leery republican officials that trump will moderate his tone in the general election and act more presidential according to people close to the campaign those reports have bothered the first time candidate who has bristled at efforts to restrain the bombastic rhetoric that helped fuel his rise manafort seems acutely aware of the sensitivity of the terrain and he pushed back after politico on friday reported that he told top gop congressional officials that his boss behavior can be changed manafort argued later that he was not referring to trump s behavior but his poll numbers explaining his negatives are going to be changing over the course of the next couple of weeks as republicans come home meanwhile lewandowski for months has been the target of whisper campaigns from a pair of erstwhile trump campaign advisers with whom he had clashed well before manafort came on board in march veteran gop operative roger stone and former stone protã gã sam nunberg last week nunberg helped facilitate a new york post page six item about an argument between lewandowski and campaign spokeswoman hope hicks on a manhattan sidewalk outside the trump campaign headquarters according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item made its way onto the post s website the person said that nunberg asked an associate to relay information about the exchange to the post which relied on a witness who quoted hicks screaming at lewandowski i am done with you hicks declined to comment for this story as did trump campaign adviser michael caputo another former stone protã gã who witnessed the incident according to two sources stone said he had nothing to do with the planting of the item and is not responsible about anything sam says or does he acknowledged emailing the page six item to some of his associates after it posted but suggested that was in service of trump it didn t reflect well on the candidate stone said i don t like anything that s harmful to donald s candidacy nunberg would not comment on whether he had a role in the page six item but he suggested trump would be well served by firing lewandowski donald loves to fire people why can t he just say it to corey said nunberg who blamed lewandowski for his own firing from the campaign last summer over a years old racist facebook post the trump campaign official sought to distance manafort and the campaign as a whole from stone and nunberg declaring there s no association with roger or sam and anyone on the campaign after nunberg was fired from trump s campaign he endorsed trump s now vanquished gop rival ted cruz and doesn t speak to the billionaire anymore that s not the case for stone the self styled dirty trickster who also has advocated conspiracy theories including that lyndon johnson was a leader in the plot to murder john f kennedy worked with manafort for years as partners in a lobbying firm and also advised trump for years before the campaign stone emphasizes that he has no formal role with the campaign but he has fashioned a role for himself as an informal adviser and high profile surrogate he has waged a months long campaign to boost trump and manafort while eviscerating perceived enemies including lewandowski using social media television and radio appearances and his own writing on conservative websites on his expletive filled twitter feed stone has publicly branded trump s campaign manager loserdowski he s urged trump to question lewandowski s loyalty calling him a snake and comparing him to the serpentine villain in a song trump recites on the stump about a woman who is killed by a snake she had rescued stone also has used twitter to lash out at barry bennett a lewandowski ally on the campaign as brainless and ignorant unpresentable and inarticulate while urging him to stay out of the media you hurt trump every time you open your mouth bennett a senior adviser to the trump campaign wouldn t respond to stone s jabs but suggested his public vitriol is not helping trump i have nothing bad to say about anyone who is working to elect donald trump bennett said i don t understand why anyone would think attacking a member of the team moves the ball forward when news broke last week that trump had promoted manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist stone took to twitter to gloat calling it a good decision and mocking lewandowski urging him to call your office but a source with knowledge of the situation said that manafort s allies had leaked the report of manafort s promotion to counteract a recent new york times magazine article that focused much more attention on lewandowski s role on the trump campaign stone tweeted that manafort s promotion made the nearly word story hopelessly dated the target list in stone s crusade against lewandowski also has come to include journalists he views as insufficiently skeptical of the campaign manager s importance or performance or overly skeptical of manafort s a group that includes reporters at politico and the washington post when the post reported that lewandowski had been tapped to head trump s vice presidential selection process stone accused bennett of being an anonymous source for the story and assailed it as inaccurate bennett declined to comment on whether he played any role in the story stone repeatedly demanded a retraction and launched into a weeks long crusade against the reporter who wrote it accusing him of being conned and worse neither the reporter or corey lewandowski knows his ass from his elbow stone tweeted demanding that the reporter resign or be fired for his false reporting and suggesting that stone intended to chat with his editor this week the post declined to comment in an interview this month with popular libertarian talk show host alex jones stone argued that lewandowski has aggrandized his role partly by leaking the vice presidential selection story before pivoting to an ironic plea for unity on the trump campaign campaigns that are divided will lose stone said now donald trump is smart enough to know that open discord in his campaign is not helpful but it is very clear that some in the entourage are more interested in feathering their own nest while others who are consummate political professionals like paul manafort are keeping their head down not playing the press game to try to burnish their own standing and their own image but focusing on getting donald j trump elected president hadas gold contibuted to this report to view online "

having trouble reading this â click here lt view url gt ted cruzâ hugs former carly fiorina during a rally in indianapolis yesterday â ap photo michael conroy the big idea â desperate times call for desperate measures if you had any doubt ted cruz was desperate he proved it yesterday by announcing carly fiorina as his running mate three months before the republican national convention and six days before a win or die indiana primary the gambit seems unlikely to change the trajectory of the race for reasons it smacks of presumptuousness it does not seem principled but political which goes against the texas senatorâ s brand it is hard to see the announcement dominating more than one news cycle cruz lost all five states that voted on tuesday finishing in third place behind donald trump and john kasich in four of them it was quite trumpian of him to change the subject with a bold stunt remember when trump rolled out the chris christie endorsement the morning after his terrible debate performance in texas but it feels inevitable that trump will say or do something today to upstage cruzâ s pickâ trump said on cnn last nightâ that he believes indiana gov mike pence will either endorse him or no one the fiorinaâ rolloutâ telegraphs that cruz does not think he will get the backing of either pence or mitch daniels the former governor both of whom would help ronald reagan and richard schweikerâ ap photo file this trick has failed every time it has been tried in on the verge of losing the nomination to incumbent president gerald ford ronald reagan announced richard schweiker as his running mate it angered his core supporters especially in the south and did nothing to peel away any delegates from the pennsylvania senatorâ s delegation which was the goal schweiker became such a liability that he offered to drop out reagan kept him fiorina cannot deliver california the only political contest fiorina has ever actually won is a republican primary in california but after losing to barbara boxer she actually moved away from the state i was in new hampshire last year when a voter told fiorina how much she loves california the then candidate awkwardly responded that she now lives in virginia and hinted pretty strongly that she doesnâ t like the state all that much as marty wilson who managed fiorinaâ s senate campaign told the los angeles times â is it a game changer no i donâ t see it that way â it deprives cruz of the chance to name a stronger running mate down the road someone like marco rubio might have actually helped cruz carry a state like florida in november cruz has lost a valuable bargaining chip at a contested convention he might have wanted to create some kind of unity ticket with kasich but that possibility is now foreclosed the mainstream media coverage this morning is pretty brutal and runs heavily negative it is certainly not what the cruz camp was hoping for reporters are grasping for various metaphors that make it seem

tracy chapman play at transit stations before tracy went on to fame spoke too soon just as the senate seemed primed to take up the thud appropriations bill drama over sen tom cotton s amendment on iran in the energy and water appropriations bill has thrown those plans into disarray majority leader mitch mcconnell withdrew the motion to proceed on thud allowing the energy and water proceedings to continue for another day that means thud definitely won t be on the docket until after next week s recess and if there s not a resolution to the cotton amendment issue that s to democrats liking

energy s darius dixon upping the expertise on wmata board rep john delaney is proposing a fix to a problem highlighted earlier this month during the house oversight committee s heated hearing on wmata the current board of directors lacks members with significant financial or engineering experience now delaney plans to introduce legislation that would require that the next three federally appointed members of the board qualify as either a certified transit expert a certified management expert or a certified financial expert and if the metro board gets overhauled as some have called for the bill would require that the majority of new appointees regardless of what jurisdiction they represent would meet the technical requirements for expertise delaney argues that it s a flexible solution how can we expect metro to be run well otherwise he said in a statement this legislation doesn t remove the ability of local jurisdictions to choose their board representatives but it does ensure a baseline level of qualifications but he didn t mention one of the major problems facing the board of directors that was raised by board chairman jack evans at the hearing with or without technical requirements it s difficult to recruit people onto the board sometimes they re there because nobody else would come believe it or not evans said at the time tsa whistleblowers deliver real talk at a

reauthorization bill was passed by a voice vote on wednesday but some democrats registered concerns about an amendment from sen dan sullivan aimed at foreign workers on foreign owned maritime vessels namely cruise ships that would limit their legal recourse in u s courts if they sue their employer sullivan said the measure would support american workers but sen richard blumenthal argued that the amendment would have the exact opposite effect encouraging cruise ships to hire foreign workers who would have little legal recourse in the united states if they were mistreated by their employer

convention wyoming democratic party nellie tayloe ross dinerelection clips presidentialdemocratic party candidateshillary clintondonald trump the man viewed to be the reincarnation of hitler by some people beats hillary clinton in three out of five national polls the former secretary of state is now losing to donald trump in an average of polls by points although a bit more optimistic huffpost pollster shows clinton only up by points over trump on april hillary clinton was up by around points and on june th of last year trump trailed clinton by about points the big issue with clinton is that she doesn t keep polling leads and election day is over five months away in contrast huffpost pollster shows bernie sanders defeating trump in a general election by points republican unifiers warn that if democrats capture the presidency and even more ominously the senate the legislative and political mischief they will propagate may pale in comparison to the more lasting damage progressives could inflict on the judiciary if elected hillary clinton undoubtedly would appoint young progressive justices to the court in an effort to control the legal agenda long after she leaves office but conservative voters should seriously consider voting for her anyway the dangers a trump presidency would pose for foreign policy isolationism and economic prosperity trade wars outweigh the constitutional distortions that would continue with a democratic administration moreover there are no guarantees that trump would appoint a principled conservative to the court even if he were elected president bernie sanderssupporters of sen bernard sanders in california have filed a federal lawsuit to extend voter registration for the state s june primary as the democrats nominating fight drags on to the bitter end the lawsuit claims election officials are not doing enough to publicize that the democratic primary is open to independent voters who have favored mr sanders throughout his challenge to hillary clinton the los angeles times reported is the left turning on its darling bernie sanders on friday netroots titan markos moulitsas namesake of the liberal daily kos dropped a rhetorical bomb on the bern blaming the candidate for doing too little to denounce death threats received by the nevada democratic party after sanders state convention delegates complained they had received unfair treatment the problem isn t bernie sanders supporters moulitsas wrote it s bernie sanders himself he refuses to forcefully and unambiguously reject that violence instead rationalizing and explaining it away with a mix of grievances and outright conspiracy theory the stakes of bernie sanders take it to the convention strategy are rapidly rising as fresh polls underscore hillary clinton s vulnerabilities and predict a tight race between her and donald trump in the fall after months of talk about the potential of a contested republican convention trump the presumptive gop nominee is quickly consolidating his party s support something clinton is unable to do with sanders still in the race democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on sunday backing a challenger to the democratic national committee s chairwoman and accusing the party s establishment of trying to anoint hillary clinton as the nominee for president in a series of television interviews sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front runner clinton republican party candidatesdonald trumpsuddenly abruptly the press is viewing donald trump as a potential president the business that gave him no chance of winning the nomination which remained in denial for months as he dispatched his gop rivals which has been operated under the assumption that hillary clinton will clobber him is starting to change its tune and it s all because of a couple of polls donald trump has said he doesn t believe in man made climate change and has called global warming a hoax but he s trying to protect a golf course he owns on the coast of ireland from its effects the presumptive gop nominee applied for a permit to build a seawall next to trump international golf links amp hotel ireland in county clare to prevent erosion according to politico his application included an environmental impact statement that explicitly mentions global warming and its effects according to politico s report that statement says that rising sea levels in that region could accelerate erosion the statement cited a study by the irish government predicting a steady rate of erosion through but the statement says that the study failed to take climate change into consideration for donald trump to win the white house in november he ll need the votes of women like elizabeth andrus yet andrus a registered republican from delaware ohio sees buffoonery in the presumptive republican nominee and says i am not on the trump train with all the trouble in the world she went on you just don t want donald trump as president her negative impression of trump was shared by most of the dozens of white suburban women from politically important states who were interviewed by the associated press this spring their views are reflected in opinion polls such as a recent ap gfk survey that found of women have unfavorable opinions of trump when democrats make the case that donald trump has a controversial background when it comes to veterans issues it s not just wishful thinking the presumptive republican nominee for example has drawn criticism for supporting a privatization plan for veterans care his associations with the sketchy veterans for a strong america exacerbated the problem and it certainly didn t help matters when trump who avoided military service during the vietnam war said he felt like he d served in the military because his parents sent him to a military themed boarding school as a teenager the republican went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military making matters much worse are new questions about trump and veterans related fundraising donald trump is getting good news in the polls last week a fox news poll saw him take a point lead over hillary clinton in a national survey that s within the margin of error but step back and take the long view clinton led by seven points in april if this is a horse race trump is clearly coming on fast even after last week s surprising polls clinton still led in the realclearpolitics nationwide average by points as of last friday but that makes the race a toss up her big lead is gone v r elias gonzalez political staff assistant veterans outreach deskdemocratic

president randi weingarten amp rep mark pocan blast trumpâ s effect on schools trump has created bullying environment excerpts from dnc media call below â as teachers weâ re going to have to work harder to help an entire generation of children recover from the hateful rhetoric that trump has aimed at immigrants muslims and black lives matter protestors â â randi weingartentoday american federation of teachers president randi weingarten and representative mark pocan joined a dnc media call to discuss teacher appreciation week and the disaster that donald trump would bring to the american education system below find excerpts from the call american federation of teachers president randi weingartenâ there is a huge difference in the way that democrats nurture honor and are grateful for teachers compared to the presumptive nominee of the republican party what weâ ve seen with donald trump is that there is now a new phenomenon in schools called the â trump effectâ washington post op ed writer petula dvorak wrote about how it will take decades to overcome the way donald trump speaks and promotes violence xenophobia and racism this is creating bullying environments in schools across the country â as teachers weâ re going to have to work harder to help an entire generation of children recover from the hateful rhetoric that trump has aimed at immigrants muslims and black lives matter protestors donald trump appeals to the worst elements in our country itâ s not a surprise to me that trump also does not respect teachers or public education teachers are on the opposite side of trump as we try to increase understanding and acceptance â he has not just called for the elimination of the department of education he has fleeced students with his fraudulent trump university schemeâ promising them a high quality college degree but only delivering them a worthless degree crippling debt and an uncertain future â itâ s not a surprise that one of trumpâ s top surrogates and possible running mates is the infamous â i want to punch teachers in the faceâ chris christie chris christie as governor has been vehemently anti teacher and anti public education â your actions speak louder than words and on teacher appreciation week weâ re seeing the presumptive nominee of the republican party doing things that will create great harm trump is creating a climate of bullying instead of uniting students together the leader of the gop who is now pushing this cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants minorities the poor and women in a way that is dividing the country making our country a less civil place to be â â itâ s a disaster to our nation if trump is selected president he has already done tremendous damage to educationâ itâ s about creating an environment of scapegoating demonizing attacking and bullying all of that is showing up on tv screens each night that is influencing children and behavior in schools we have a responsibility to help children by promoting understanding and tolerance and celebrate diversity what trump is doing is the opposite this is a very dangerous turn in american democracy â representative mark pocanâ as democrats we are proud to stand with teachers unfortunately this enthusiasm isnâ t shared on the other side of the aisle as randi said donald trump has a history of attacks on education and teachers he has called for teachers unions to be weakened he has called for eliminating the department of education and he has sought to profit off of students trying to improve their futures through his fraudulent trump university â as randi said trumpâ s nomination was not an accident republican leaders paved the way for donald trump with their years of divisive rhetoric and obstructionist policies trumpâ s recklessness would hurt our economy diminish our standing in the world and make our communities less safe trump is dangerous and he lacks the judgment or temperament to be president â and just like republicans in washington have done for years dangerous donald is only looking out for himself again look no further than his fraudulent trump university as evidence he fleeced thousands of americans looking to get ahead for his own personal enrichment â trump owes everything to the tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family he does not understand the struggle that regular families face or what it takes for the average american to get ahead his businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt leaving investors contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions trump actually said at one of the republican partyâ s debates that â wages are too highâ and opposed raising the minimum wage on education and the economy our country canâ t afford donald trump â "

as angry as watching cable tv would lead you to believe but many poorer less educated folks who have been left behind in the st centuryâ the ones who have seen their wages stagnate their opportunities for upward mobility disappear and their life expectancies shortenâ are looking to disrupt a status quo that has not worked for them thatâ s what sanders and trump are both promising to do fewer than in democratic primary voters in west virginia identified as â very liberal â tying oklahoma for the lowest in any of this yearâ s contests yet sanders carried both states in fact sanders won among self identified moderate to conservative democrats in each so how did the septuagenarian socialist do it the bottom line is most people are not voting for bernie because he is liberal they are voting for him because they perceive his promised â political revolutionâ as a challenge to the system that has failed them bernie photo by justin sullivan getty images only percent of democratic primary voters in west virginia said they want the next president to continue barack obamaâ s policies clinton won that group by a more than to margin sanders won around two thirds of voters who want the next president to pursue more liberal policies than obama and over half of voters who preferred more conservative policies in oklahoma sanders also won with those who rejected obamaâ s policies as too liberal and those who said the president is too conservative west virginia may be an outlier in some ways it will not be in play during the general election and clinton is still marching toward the democratic nomination but this sense of disaffection cannot be ignored by the elites in either party any longer itâ s hard for the chattering class in d c â essentially an island of prosperity â to appreciate how much parts of the country are still struggling from the after effects of the great recession and the degree to which they were struggling to begin with â this tweet from a normally smart democratic strategist is a great example last night showed once again that white working class voters in economically depressed areas are not ready for hillary this could become a genuine problem in the fall campaign especially as trump focuses on trying to flip states in the rust belt from pennsylvania to michigan and ohio three in democratic primary voters said they or a family member is employed in the coal industry and these voters favored sanders by more than points over clinton wapoâ pollster scott clement notes sandersâ lead was smaller about points among voters in non coal households according to the preliminary numbers clinton faced criticism for saying â weâ re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business â check out how well trump has performed across appalachia during the gop primaries d c is so used to a left right continuum but many voters donâ t think that way this is partly why most of the pundits around town still cannot

influencing contest a challenge the protest organization drew no mention during the second gop presidential debate there were more than words uttered during the three hour republican presidential primary debate wednesday night none of them were black lives matter for more than a year the nation has been locked in a passionate discussion about race and policing driven by the killing of unarmed black men and women by police officers but as underscored wednesday night the movement that has funneled thousands of protesters into american streets prompted new scrutiny of law enforcement and forced democratic presidential candidates into several stumbles on the trail has yet to receive significant attention in the gop race how to best influence the presidential contest remains a challenge for activists and organizers working under the black lives matter banner in part because different factions of the movement disagree starkly over the best way to do so those tactical disagreements will be front and center this weekend during the congressional black caucus foundation s annual policy conference which features an expansive list of panels with participants as diverse as protesters and policymakers who have risen to prominence during the current protest movement the real goal is to drive the narrative around the presidential debate said nick mosby the baltimore city council member who represents the neighborhood where riots erupted this spring after the death of freddie gray of an injury he suffered while in police custody and that s really hard several protest groups have vowed to continue staging demonstrations at candidates public appearances a tactic that has drawn significant criticism in political and protest circles other activists including deray mckesson who is perhaps the nation s most widely recognized protester linked to the movement have focused on policy meetings pressuring candidates to engage on the details of policing and criminal justice on wednesday mckesson was among activists who met separately with sen bernie sanders i vt and valerie jarrett a senior adviser to president obama to discuss campaign zero their policing and criminal justice policy platform the movement have brought issues of police and criminal justice to the forefront in ways that we haven t seen in decades mckesson said all of the campaigns will continue to need to think deeply about the issues that the unrest has brought to the fore and on friday a new bipartisan group comprising young black lawmakers and public professionals will arrive in washington to meet with the democratic and republican national committees with the hope of succeeding where they think the young activists have fallen short thus far getting the gop candidates to take policing reform seriously the republican candidates are not the only ones under pressure some of the movement s biggest headlines of the summer came when members interrupted democratic candidates sanders and martin o malley during a liberal policy conference organized in phoenix by the group netroots nation our group was pretty much solidified after the netroots situation said ashley bell who is one of two chairs of leaders of america an alliance of young black elected officials and policymakers that is evenly composed of democrats and republicans but the disruptive protests were not an unqualified success they drew criticism from many on both sides of the political aisle causing some who want to see policing and criminal justice reform to worry that the protest movement would not be taken seriously by presidential candidates there was a lot of concern that we needed to make sure the candidates had a venue and marketplace to talk about these issues said bell a republican and former county commissioner in hall county ga the next president might not be african american if not we need to make sure the next president understands the issues that affect black communities bell said his group has held preliminary policy talks with the presidential campaigns of sen rand paul r ky and gov scott walker r wisc the group has also invited the candidates to a presidential forum in november at allen university in south carolina an rnc official confirmed wednesday that during the meeting friday will present policy proposals on policing and criminal justice that are being considered for inclusion in the republican party s party platform we definitely have a long way to go said aja brown the mayor of compton calif who is in washington this week we have to get to that moment where all of the candidates are really discussing the issues at the forefront of the national headlines so we can have a candid conversation about race education and economic opportunity in two debates that stretched for a combined five hours the candidates in the republican presidential field were asked just one question about what some on the left consider a new civil rights movement it was wildly disappointing for them to have a three hour debate wednesday and not once bring up these issues which have completely altered the national conversation mckesson said on wednesday night the only time the word police was uttered by a candidate was during a response by paul about medical marijuana the most memorable of just a handful of exchanges about criminal justice reform involved jeb bush s apology to his mother for smoking marijuana years ago our country is at a fork in the road said chelsi henry a conservative columnist for ebony magazine and a member of these issues have come up during presidential elections before what makes it so unique this time around is that we want to see more than a talking point that has been the message delivered consistently by mckesson and the others who came to prominence as activists after the fatal police shooting of michael brown in ferguson mo in that message was the focus of their sit down with sanders on wednesday the activists who met with sanders were mckesson johnetta elzie brittany packnett and samuel sinyangwe the team behind campaign zero as well as erika totten a washington based activist and organizer and martinez sutton the brother of rekia boyd an unarmed black woman who was shot and killed by an off duty police officer in chicago in after that session mckesson elzie and packnett went to the white house and met with jarrett and roy austin jr the deputy assistant to the president for urban affairs in a meeting that included phillip agnew of the dream defenders and jamye wooten of baltimore united for change we ve seen broad engagement with campaign zero at all levels of the politics mckesson said i m encouraged and i m hopeful that the conversation with the white house is a beginning and will result in tangible things that affect these issues the conversation only matters if it informs practice that impacts people s lives campaign zero has earned the praise of prominent democratic operatives and some activists but it has also drawn the skepticism of some activists not involved in it highlighting significant divisions among the young activists there is no doubt in my mind that our country must be aggressive in addressing institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system sanders said in a statement after his meeting with the activists i look forward to a continuing dialogue with campaign zero and other voices from communities of color to address deeply entrenched racial and economic problems in our country sanders and hillary rodham clinton the front runner in the democratic presidential race are aggressively courting black voters who were crucial to the obama coalition it s not going to be easy to get our votes patrisse cullors another police reform activist said in a previous interview but if they re feeling compelled to meet with the people who have been leading the black lives matter movement then things are headed in the right direction washington post blogs

soffer over a million mortgage that was originated by bankatlantic the lawsuit was not a foreclosure but sought to force the borrowers to repay the loan south florida business journal january settlement appears likely in fontainebleau las vegas bankruptcy case fontainebleau las vegas the soffers are on the verge of settling with creditors over the debacle once known as the fontainebleau las vegas a still skeletal billion high rise in sin city that ranks as one of the biggest busts of the u s real estate crisis a federal bankruptcy judge in miami said wednesday he was inclined to approve a million settlement that would pay contractors on the failed casino tower about cents on the dollar contractors would divvy up about million for a total claims pool of million but which a creditor lawyer said would probably end up closer to million once negotiations are finished the money will be paid out to creditors and lawyers in arbitration or by court order a process that could add another year or two onto a case that began with a chapter bankruptcy filing in june construction lenders would recoup about million i certainly have sympathy for all of the people who have money coming to them and seem to have been waiting forever judge a jay cristol told an audience about lawyers half of them participating by speaker phone at an afternoon hearing in downtown miami the settlement money would come from the million in sale proceeds paid by corporate raider carl icahn when he bought the unfinished tower out of bankruptcy in the money has been in an frozen escrow account pending the bankruptcy outcome an additional million would come from title companies that backed the project as well as from a million completion guarantee funded by jeff soffer and his sister jacquelyn the brother and sister team run the family s real estate firm turnberry which got its start with the creation of aventura and now includes both the aventura mall and the fontainebleau miami beach the story fontainebleau vegas is described in court papers as essentially a tear down valuable for its land on the north end of the strip but burdened by a five year old unfinished tower that icahn may demolish while judge cristol said the settlement would probably meet his approval he said he would consider written objections by a las vegas contractor who wanted its million lawsuit against jeff soffer protected from the settlement a million settlement by mr soffer to get out of all the problems he is currently facing is not a large amount said henry marinello a miami lawyer representing the tracy and ryder landscape inc a large nevada based landscaping contractor the settlement would end claims by lenders and contractors in the bankruptcy case but the soffers still face litigation involving the fontainebleau vegas jeff soffer the lead developer in both fontainebleau projects has blamed the vegas debacle on lehman brothers cutting off funds after it collapsed in followed by some of the nation s top banks holding back about million in construction funds slated for completing the project but lenders accused soffer and his development team at turnberry of mismanagement and over spending allegations repeated by the bankruptcy trustee in a separate suit seeking damages from soffer and his top executives that litigation is still pending and will not be covered by the settlement the soffers did not attend the hearing jeff soffer presided over fontainebleau vegas and put in million cash collateral for the million completion guarantee before the

should get the money back since the funds could only be used to complete a project that now had no hope of being finished the two essentially surrendered their claims to the money as part of the settlement said mario romine general counsel for turnberry associates soneet kapila a fort lauderdale accountant appointed as bankruptcy trustee for the case blamed the four years leading up to the a settlement on the fact that the case is one of the most complicated ever to be heard in south florida when it is high level and sophisticated litigation there are a lot of things to resolve he said it s the nature of it the miami herald november previously resolved issues by dnc vet comthe soffer family and turnberry also have counterclaims against the las vegas resort s lenders the counterclaims which use details from an examiner s report about the collapse of lehman said lehman hid its true financial condition jeff soffer signed a settlement agreement with the bank in january but the counterclaims are still pending a logical question is why would a bank substitute a defendant s sister in collecting the judgement attempts to obtain an explanation regarding the matter from the soffers or their spokesman david satterfield were not successful by deadline other attorneys offered several possible reasons jackie soffer might have reached a lower settlement figure with the bank the family might have wanted to equitably share the financial impact the switch might be part of a broader legal strategy regarding debts related to the las vegas resort the judgment for jackie soffer

he was there years working with them according to weiner s lawsuit he was a percent owner of turnberry residential the suit says he and the soffers took out loans from turnberry residential when it was financed in with a million loan and credit line from prudential real estate investors according to weiner s suit the soffers then caused the company to reclassify the loans as distributions without offering weiner the same privilege weiner alleges he should have received percent of that million distribution weiner also alleges he is still owed money from commissions on sales at turnberry s rosslyn a large luxury condominium in arlington va with views of the washington monument olin scoffed at the notion that turnberry owes any money to weiner he s out to lunch he said of weiner s

to court friday in their six year old legal fight over a private jet an attorney for robins wants last month s million judgment thrown out because of alleged juror misconduct according to the miami herald the attorney dennis richard claims three of the six jurors who sided with colombo did not disclose their criminal records and involvement in multiple lawsuits colombo s attorney says the argument is meritless nearly four years ago robins dacra development filed a lawsuit against colombo s cmc group that alleged colombo agreed to buy half of a million bombardier challenger but failed to follow through on the agreement lawsuit describes art blacklist to keep some collectors awayimagine a market for highly sought after items in which the makers and sellers work hard to ensure that the items go only to certain buyers even if other buyers might be willing to pay more the favored buyers are then expected not to resell the items for many years even if the values skyrocket ideally in fact the buyers are expected to give these items away eventually for the public good and if the buyers don t abide by these expectations they risk being cut off cast out with the other unwashed wealthy who can afford to buy but have no access at least according to craig robins a prominent miami art collector and real estate developer who filed a federal lawsuit on march in manhattan this is a portrait of the workings of the primary market for contemporary art which despite the recession remains immense and highly competitive at its heart the million suit is a fairly ordinary contract dispute about confidentiality agreements and sales promises but the details of the disagreement have provided a rare view into a normally very private world of high end art selling in which membership rules responsibilities rewards and reprisals can be so complex and changeable that even art world veterans say they sometimes struggle to decode them mr robins asserts that he sold a painting of a dark figure by the highly praised south african born artist marlene dumas through the david zwirner gallery in chelsea in with an agreement that the sale remain confidential but the gallery which did not yet represent ms dumas told her about it mr robins claims causing her to become angry with him because like many artists she prefers to see her paintings remain long term in prominent collections mr robins says that ms dumas one of whose paintings sold for more than million at sotheby s in maintains an active blacklist of those she views as speculating in her work a blacklist that he says he is now on and whose existence his lawyers who were back in court on the case this week say they plan to prove the suit which claims million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from the gallery also claims that mr zwirner promised to help get mr robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from against the wall the current show of ms dumas s work at zwirner which is now her gallery but that this did not happen in its legal response the gallery has called the suit baseless saying it had never promised choice works or confidentiality after the sale by bringing suit the gallery s lawyers argue the wealthy robins has literally made a federal case of not being able to buy what he wants when he wants as for the supposed blacklist the lawyers added as if addressing a purely philosophical problem if such a list exists and if robins is on it zwirner did not put him there and cannot take him off but several dealers art advisers and collectors specializing in contemporary art said in recent interviews that with the explosion of the art market over the last several years and a sharp rise in the number of speculative buyers entering the market those who sell art have become much more wary of collectors motives and that they keep in addition to secret waiting lists for in demand artists another even more secret list of buyers suspected of wanting to flip art for a quick profit even serious collectors who are generally regarded more as keepers than as sellers complain that in recent years several dealers and highly involved artists like ms dumas have gone overboard in their protectiveness and desire to control an artwork s destiny after it is sold i think sometimes there s a fair amount of hypocrisy from some of these dealers said adam lindemann a longtime collector and author of a book collecting contemporary that offers advice to aspiring collectors i m not buying a can of sardines here mr lindemann said i m buying something that i m in love with but times change and sometimes you need to sell things mr robins s suit and a similar one filed in against a new york dealer by a prominent european collector jean pierre lehmann who also complained of an inability to buy choice works are seen as evidence by some within the collecting world that the contemporary art market has become so contentious that even serious long term collectors are now being pushed into fights mr robins for example owns works by ms dumas and has called her one of the top three artists in my collection mr zwirner and ms dumas declined to comment about the lawsuit mr robins s lawyer aaron richard golub also declined to comment except to offer a general observation about dealers they might say they re motivated by trying to place pieces in museums and the right collections and such but at the end of the day it s all about profit nexis the new york times high flying partners dispute jet paymentsdacra development corp headed by

breach of his agreement with us we plan to collect and make sure you are paid robins attorney dennis richard says the bill is inaccurate because some of cmc s expenses were charged to dacra also he says colombo had agreed to buy out robins interest in the jet colombo says there were talks but no deal was struck we were negotiating but we didn t come to an agreement colombo says this was before

press host chuck todd that trump had cleared the way for non traditional candidates to enter the presidential fray shown that the conventional political wisdom does not always prove accurate and eliminated the need for stepford candidates all of that is good for the country in the long term cuban said in the short term trump s candidacy has produced some things not so great for the country

for vice president has already received the sort of attention third party candidates dream of in an interview with the new york times weld said he could hear the glass crunching on kristallnacht when he contemplated donald trump s deportation agenda in an interview with cnn weld talked confidently about a libertarian campaign being able to nudge the democrats toward the economic center and nudge the republicans to get away from their antiabortion stance yet the outnumbered but determined band of conservatives looking for a third party savior are looking elsewhere on saturday morning pollster doug schoen released the results of a poll conducted in mid may with likely voters fifty one percent liked the idea of a third party candidate twenty percent would favor a generic candidate in a race

contemplate what it reveals about how much and how quickly american society has changed only five years ago openly gay people were barred from serving in its armed forces during mr fanning s lengthy confirmation process his sexual orientation was simply not an issue that is a tribute to those who fought so hard to repeal the ban and a measure of the nation s at times uncertain but as yet unfailing march toward equality in retrospect the fight that convulsed this country over whether gay americans should serve in uniform seems senseless almost absurd yet it is instructive if only because a pentagon plan to allow transgender americans to serve openly in uniform remains stalled by a similar albeit quieter debate new york times the editorial boardobama focused on the noneconomic reasons for going to college the skills gained in college he said are tools to help make the right choices away from fear and division and paralysis and toward cooperation and innovation and hope it was an important reminder well suited to the times and the occasion but it also came across as if the economic benefits of college were a given in fact the familiar assumption graduate from college and prosperity will follow has been disproved in this century college educated workers have not seen meaningful pay raises and public policy has failed to address the stagnation it is true that as a group college graduates make more than high school graduates this gap is one reason that politicians like mr obama hillary clinton bernie sanders and donald trump want to make college more affordable college affordability is thus linked to equality of opportunity since however inflation adjusted pay for college graduates has risen a measly cents an hour to about on average that s surely better than the cents an hour drop for high school educated workers in the same period to a little less than but standing still while others regress is no cause for celebration washington post the editorial

stroking behind the scenes but in reality there s absolutely no doubt who wears the pants i asked folks in the mayor s office and cps if they wanted to comment i got this statement which gives

chicago newsroom s ken davis interviews lewis lewis at we support senate bill as a first step it s not a solution to the problem and while it does look like it s taking from the rich and giving to the poor what it does is it starts us on a road to equity not equality but equity and i think that people don t understand the difference between the two concepts especially when you use property taxes as the majority of funding for public schools there s always going to be this huge gap an inequality from the very beginning so if we re going to evaluate people equally then we have to have some sort of

advantage opening up the possibility that we ll see the biggest political landslide in a three person race since when ronald reagan carried states and secured electoral votes consequences of trump s candidacy for senate control with trump at the top of the ticket no party has been more vulnerable to a political tsunami in the u s senate since when ronald reagan was elected president in a

through a board policyâ manual framework and other important policies nonprofit organizations will often point to their board policy manual as the essential document keeping them on track fulfilling their mission there are other organizations however that may not have a manual and may not know if the policies that their boards have adopted are even adequate in terms of the scope of activities they cover or if the contents of their policies do a good job of expressing the board s intent this can be risky there is the obvious danger that poorly written policies or the wrong policies not only leave the staff to make decisions beyond their authority but can also expose the nonprofit to possible legal liability â a good way to reduce these risks is with a well written and comprehensive board policy manual the policy manual needs to fit the requirements of the organization and may for example include sections relating to charter board operations personnel policies financial records board organization and so on and within each section there might be individual policies relating to conflict of interest fiscal management whistleblower protections personnel record retention and other areas the individual policies should also be reviewed periodically and certain other important documents will likely be added including board meeting minutes executive director reports committee reports audit reports and so on this is a lot to organize and keep current but is important for the success of your mission and the operation of your organization â please join john bradley attorney

Congressmen rally to push Ways &amp; Means on transpo funding","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers and lauren gardner am edtwith help from heather caygle and jennifer scholtesntsb settles on amtrak derailment findings here s what we know going into today s national transportation safety board debriefing on last year s amtrak derailment in philadelphia investigators are planning to declare that the crash occurred after engineer brandon bostian became distracted by radio chatter about a nearby commuter train that had reported being hit with a projectile according to a source familiar with the investigation bostian likely became disoriented and lost situational awareness of his location on the track as he pushed the train s throttle to its maximum speed of mph on a curve with a designated speed of mph and here s what else we know the amtrak investigation is prompting ntsb to take a closer look at proposed rules on two person crews a little birdie briefed on the proposed findings tells our lauren gardner that ntsb will likely urge fra to start collecting data to help determine whether two person crews are indeed safer than having one employee at the controls readers remember that the agency proposed largely mandating two person crews in march even though fra acknowledged some data holes while arguing for the rule while solo acts are rare right now in the industry freights have indicated they d like to go that route once ptc is widely implemented fwiw in this latest case bostian was alone in the cab when he hit the throttle to its max speed fra s proposal would ensure the second crewmember maintains contact with the engineer but it wouldn t require that person to remain in the cab with the driver the board is also set to recommend that regulators ensure locomotives have tracking devices installed that show engineers the speed limit and location along tracks where positive train control has yet to be implemented it s tuesday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains planes automobiles and ports mt was delighted to recently

monday that it plans to veto the senate s fiscal proposal to fund dot and housing and military programs the administration is disappointed that the bill does not support the president s vision for a st century clean transportation plan that expands transportation options for american families while reducing carbon emissions cutting oil consumption and creating new jobs the office of management and budget said in its statement of administration policy the administration urges the congress to consider strategic opportunities to enhance revenue and investments it all comes back to trucking the white house also quibbled with the thud bill s hour trucking work provision saying that it has the potential to undercut public safety sen dianne feinstein d calif a vocal opponent of other initiatives pushed by the trucking industry like twin s also has her concerns about the provision whether she s concerned enough about the issue to offer an amendment that s another question i haven t had a chance to look at it but i will look at it and i will talk with sen susan collins about it feinstein told lauren i know the compromise is hours the point is that we re making progress i don t know how much progress is realistic to expect amendments go thud we couldn t resist utilizing the bill s onomatopoeia senators have started filing amendments to our beloved t section of the thud bill and we have some highlights virginia dems mark warner and tim kaine want to change the treatment of the federal lands transportation program by placing it among the programs that have their obligation

sure faa has the money to revise its regulations for third class medical certification for ga pilots sen dan sullivan is pushing for bridges deemed structurally deficient to be rebuilt without having to go through environmental permitting processes sen heidi heitkamp is proposing a report evaluating the impact of collegiate flight training on the economy and airport infrastructure a graves outlook rep sam graves r mo was all realtalk at his appearance at monday s aashto eno center of transportation confab on disruptive technologies where he forecast the future of congressional regulation of innovative transportation technologies such as self driving cars and vehicle to infrastructure communications in short his picture is far from rosy the technology is moving so fast it really is hard to keep up with graves said though the best opportunity would be to have a proactive approach to all of these things the reality is and what scares me to death more than anything else is that it s going to end up being a reactive approach there s going to be an accident or something s going to happen something in a catastrophic way and then it turns into a reactionary item and congress will go too far they always do and then it comes back to the center but it takes time to take that corrective action and that s what worries me a tire tax graves also talked about the fast act s funding shortcomings to be quite honest with you the funding package that we have in the bill right now is really quite temporary a lot of it doesn t have anything to do with transportation we ve got to look at some other options everything s on the table everything from tolling to vehicle miles traveled to even the tire tax sneak peek graves said he s working on a letter to ways and means leadership calling on the group to begin to grapple in earnest with a new funding method for the highway trust fund that would be incorporated into the next major tax reform bill mt scrounged up a rough draft of the letter which graves is planning to send out next week and it s already got more than tentative co signs from other members of congress the highlights of the letter now is the time to begin searching for a solution to the htf s long term shortfall but we recognize there is likely no silver bullet and congress must consider a range of options to address this problem as the committee pursues tax reform over the coming months and years we urge you to consider the sweeping impact tax policy has on the htf and our transportation network presented by norwegian air affordable fares to

to wage war against norwegian air international on monday they submitted a joint filing to the department of transportation objecting to the agency s tentative approval of the low cost airline s proposal to operate service in the united states arguing that the nai s entrance into the u s market fails to serve the public interest and would be in violation of the u s eu air transport agreement from the filing to dot faced with an application for a foreign air carrier permit by a european air carrier that its parent airline admittedly established in an eu country for the purpose of avoiding the labor rules of its parent s home country the department has tentatively determined that article of the air transport agreement cannot be used to deny the application this proposed determination is wholly at odds with the terms and purposes of article bis and the agreement as a whole the department should reverse its tentative decision and issue a new order stating that it proposes to deny the carrier s application what s next the deadline for initial comments about dot s tentative ruling on nai were supposed to come earlier this month but the due date was pushed back a week at the request

declared friday that it s backing the freight rail industry in an ongoing battle over whether amtrak can act as both a commercial interest and a governmental regulatory authority when helping to determine which railroads get the most and best access to track right of way the court s take a law that allowed amtrak to act in both capacities was unconstitutional because armed with coercive regulatory power amtrak wields a weapon of considerable advantage in its competitive battle for scarce track a three judge panel of the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit said in the opinion what are the long term effects of this decision our lauren gardner explains the decision deals another blow to dot s attempt to develop performance metrics with fra to ensure timely passenger service challenges to which have wound through the courts for years what effect it could have on the surface transportation board s clunky efforts to define on time performance and the decades old concept of preference to amtrak over freight operations is unclear flashback from english class railroad nerds perusing the court s page decision may notice a literary easter egg straight from the post war american canon an excerpt from john steinbeck s east of eden that s used to make a point about train punctuality train schedules are a matter of pride and of apprehension to nearly everyone steinbeck writes when far up the track the block signal snapped from red to green and the long stabbing probe of the headlight sheered the bend and blared on the station men looked at their watches and said on time there was pride in it and relief too one thing late or early can disrupt everything around it and the disturbance runs outward in bands like the waves from a dropped stone in a quiet pool back to the courtroom from steinbeck s prose the court s decision segued back to the passenger rail investment and improvement act of it may be said that priia s architects shared steinbeck s pride in the punctuality of train schedules the court declared but as we ve shown there are limits to how far congress may go to ensure amtrak s on time performance speaking of amtrak happy th birthday to america

documenting amtrak s inaugural day politico pro suuct headline amtrak chugs in with few aboard little confusion or fanfare and usual low patronage mark new day on rails coming today the competitive enterprise institute is planning to file a lawsuit today against tsa arguing that a rule published earlier this year on the use of body scanners to conduct security screening in the lawsuit cei says that tsa has downplayed the intrusiveness of body scanners in their push to replace walk through metal detectors the organization argues that the body scanners will cause many would be airline passengers to choose to drive instead and that change of mode could result in increased traffic fatalities from cei s marc scribner while the tsa is promoting body scanners as a security measure the odds are that this rule actually puts the traveling public at greater risk not less they failed to account for the invasiveness and delays associated with the tsa s scanners that prompt some air travelers to take to their cars instead which is a riskier mode of travel than flying do we really neeed to ship american politico s the agenda has a deep dive into the jones act a century old maritime statute requiring that goods shipped from one u s port to another must travel on a ship built in america with an american crew and owned by americans and its role in the heated debate over puerto rico s future from the story by danny vinik for puerto rico opponents say the law drives up costs of everything from energy to consumer goods as policymakers look for ways to ease the island s financial burdens the jones act has come under the microscope as an example of ways that domestic u s laws disproportionately drive up costs for a distant and cash strapped territory though it s not in the house draft of the puerto rico relief package it has come up at congressional hearings and an amendment exempting puerto rico will likely be offered when the bill hits the floor salim furth of

and we have these million people who are stuck on an island and we re just going to take their money because we can all things being equal the coast guard has filed a declaration of equivalency asserting that existing u s laws on verifying shipping container weights are adequate to comply with the new solas international shipping weight measurement requirements the declaration issued late last week states that current regulatory regime provides for other entities within the container export chain to work in combination with the shipper to determine and verify container weights what does that mean now ocean carriers have extra encouragement to work with shippers to find the least onerous or least costly methods to verify the weight of containers and their contents the ongoing

s smallest violin to play a sad sad song first look ii budget committee ripped qorvis stan collender in opening remarks prepared for a house budget committee hearing this morning on reclaiming congressional authority through the power of the purse the premise of this hearing is that the white house has seized control over the budget and usurped congress power of the purse this is completely false the white house has not seized control over spending and taxing instead congress has willfully and shamefully ceded its fiscal powers by refusing to exercise them and any attempt to characterize it differently is nothing more than political misdirection actually saying that congress has abrogated its power of the purse duties gives it way too much credit in reality the house and senate have been running away almost at full speed from their legally required budget responsibilities and they have been doing it with impunity how else can you characterize this committee s refusal to hold a

by ben white am edtdonald trump s debt problem politico s ben white donald trump has a debt problem twice in the last five days the presumptive republican nominee has said things about dealing with the trillion federal debt that left wall street terrified republicans dumbfounded and democrats licking their chops the trouble for trump began thursday on cnbc when he appeared to suggest that as president he would not repay all the u s debt owed to creditors asked if the u s should repay its debts in full or ask creditors to take less trump said i would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal financial experts instantly leaped on the comments suggesting that trump who is no stranger to bankruptcy as an executive would allow the u s to default for the first time in its history an event which could send interest rates soaring and tank the u s economy failed clean up attempt trump went on cnn on monday morning to clear things up of course he would never allow the u s to default anyone who suggested such a thing must be crazy what trump meant to say was that if interests rates rise he would consider buying back existing u s debt at a lower prices as interest rates rise the price of existing debt goes down but then he landed himself right back in the soup this is the united states government trump said first of all you never have to default because you print the money i hate to tell you that comment that the u s can simply pay back its trillions of dollars in debt by printing a ton more money drove wall street crazy again if there is ever an example of how dumb it is to print money to handle debt i m in a country which has had had to learn that the hard way more than once said david kotok chief investment officer at cumberland advisors speaking from a conference in argentina quote of the day aaf s douglas holtz eakin on trump s latest comments on debt this is yet another big misstep what he is implying is the era of fed independence is over i no longer know what trump does and doesn t know about managing the debt but i m pretty sure i don t trust his judgment i also worry about the international community watching this daily they have reason to be nervous about him if i were advising him i d say let s take a day or two off of this and talk about beauty pageants or something else you know about because this has got to stop lew on trump via politico s colin wilhelm i m not going to comment on what anyone s saying on the campaign trail we have the deepest most liquid market in the world for u s treasury bonds and that s based on the fact that it has been a priority to treat servicing of our debt as a responsibility that we have to take very very seriously how trump and clinton invest bloomberg s charles stein the vanguard index fund is hillary and bill clinton s top holding they ve invested between million and million in it the billion fund which charges a percent fee is the only investment listed

as THUD awaits â€” Takataâ€™s financial future looks bad, and may get even worse","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from heather caygle and darius dixonuber lyft opt for big statement in austin uber and lyft are shutting down ride hailing operations in austin texas after the city s residents voted in favor of driver fingerprinting requirements and restrictions on picking up passengers in traffic lanes a drastic move that could have widespread implications for the rideshare industry in other american cities together the companies spent millions of a dollars on a wall to wall marketing campaign aimed at persuading voters to reject the regulations and now they re quitting the city out of protest here s the real question will this method of political brinkmanship spread to other cities with rideshare giants uber and lyft threatening to snatch away their services if they don t get their way on election day as the wall street journal notes uber has used this tactic to pressure local regulators in portland ore las vegas and miami and it has since resumed operations in those cities the austin american statesman weighed in on the brouhaha applauding voters who pushed back against big rideshare but also called for local politicians to find grounds for negotiation all too often lyft and uber have demonstrated a bullying attitude openly flouting city laws to enter the austin market then demanding that the city bend to their business models or else that might fly in some other cities but it doesn t work in austin where even residents inclined to support lyft and uber were put off by such tactics the paper wrote in an editorial monday night while some might be gloating over prop s failure now austin residents are not likely to look favorably in the future on elected officials who opted for complacency that should be incentive enough for the city council to issue an invitation to lyft and uber to return to negotiations but on equal terms this time around it s tuesday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains

john kloosterman of united airlines the budget saga continues for the third time senate democrats on monday night blocked the energy and water spending bill over a controversial amendment on iran s heavy water pushed by republican sen tom cotton senate majority leader mitch mcconnell then filed cloture on the amendment setting up a procedural vote no later than wednesday that will require senators to agree to advance the amendment pro energy s darius dixon explains the strategy behind the move if as expected cotton falls short he plans to withdraw the amendment and the senate will likely proceed to votes on the underlying spending bill sen lamar alexander the energy and water appropriations subcommittee chair said on the floor monday evening why do we care senate appropriators are anxious to get to the transportation housing and urban development budget bill but the appropriations package is in a holding pattern until the energy and water bill either gets passed by the full senate or is placed on the shelf in case you forgot heritage action for america is still fighting in opposition to rep bill shuster s faa bill calling on members of the house to abandon the bill in a letter sent monday they argue that the labor provisions in the proposal amount to a dangerous union giveaway and that a privatized air traffic control system would result in runaway costs and less stable american skyways the letter ticks off a list of potential labor issues associated with the plan that the conservative groups say will give unions the upper hand essentially erasing all the cost saving and efficiency benefits touted by shuster backers simply put the protections employed by former president ronald reagan during the illegal air traffic controller strike in will no longer be available heritage action wrote so nice you say it twice it s not the first time heritage action has spoken out against the bill the conservative organization sent out a missive lambasting the bill back in february at the time heritage warned that a reorganized air traffic control system could keep taxpayers on the hook for serious missteps bracing for impact takata s latest full year financial forecast estimates that it lost million last year because of the cost related to recall efforts and lawsuits from the families of airbag inflator victims and that doesn t even take into account the most recent announcement from nhtsa that doubled the amount of cars in the u s under recall bloomberg reports the company had posted about million in profit the year before takata s recall crisis is like the titanic hitting the iceberg analyst takeshi miyao told bloomberg you don t realize the enormity until you see the impact from it making a case for gateway common good predicts that building the gateway rail tunnel project between new york and new jersey would save taxpayers billions of dollars in the long run in a new report the advocacy organization outlines the costs of waiting to execute the project which was just ballyhooed by transportation secretary anthony foxx last week when compared to an month process to finish review and permitting a three year permitting timetable would increase taxpayer cost of the project by over billion and a further two year delay would increase costs by almost billion another two years would raise costs by more than billion common good writes the calculations include the construction cost increase from delay delayed construction benefits lost business activity lost property tax revenue delay in environmental benefits and additional costs from shutting down one or both existing tunnels asce talks downstream costs the american society of civil engineers is expected to release a report later today with new data and analysis on america s infrastructure funding shortfall the study is an update on a report released several years ago that concluded that families lose per year in personal household income because of the government s failure to adequately invest in infrastructure here s our guess that number will have grown even larger since the original report too close for comfort the faa is bringing on three new companies to help improve the detection and identification of drones flying too close to airports in an announcement on monday faa officials said that they decided to expand the agency s pathfinder

sen bill nelson who frequently raises the alarm about drones spotted in close proximity to airports praised the announcement but called for more programs aimed at reducing the potential threats of

pace","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edttrump doubles down on deportation in an interview with nbc nightly news on wednesday night presumptive gop nominee donald trump again said he would seek to deport million undocumented immigrants currently living in the united states yes they re going to be deported look we either have a country or we don t we have many illegals in the country and we have to get them out and go through a process go through a system and ones that have done well and have really achieved we want to bring em back in the first trump days nyt s patrick healy he would start building a government based on relationships perhaps inviting the republican leaders paul d ryan and mitch mcconnell to escape the chilly washington fall and schmooze at mar a lago over golf and two pound lobsters on inauguration day he would go to a beautiful gala ball or two but focus mostly on rescinding obama executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the united states let s take on a few of those calling up and haranguing business leaders over relocations seems more like the hallmark of democratic administration republicans usually focus on changing the incentives that often cause companies to relocate especially a complex tax code with the highest corporate rate in the oecd at percent which is also the third highest in the world behind only puerto rico chad and the uae we are also not aware of executive authority to unilaterally punish individual companies that move jobs abroad trump can certainly design a wall and try to convince mexico to fund it but mexico is probably not going to do that and congress is not likely to approve the spending it would take to build the wall congress is also not likely to approve a ban on muslims immigrating to the u s which the supreme court could also toss out as an unconstitutional religious test and the fed is already extensively audited so starting a new audit would be redundant changing oversight of the fed would also require an act of congress m m side note i talked to multiple members of congress at the milken conference and most of them wanted to change the subject when the question of supporting trump came up one gop senator suddenly had an urgent meeting to get to as soon as i started down that line of questioning the big idea is the economy better than we think wells capital s jim paulsen the current economic recovery has been the slowest of the post war era indeed throughout this recovery u s real gdp has hovered near the stall speed of about percent what if the pace of real gdp growth during this recovery was actually closer to percent rather than sustaining near the mendoza line official reports suggest u s productivity has grown at its slowest pace of any economic recovery in the post war era however the real wage rate has been climbing steadily throughout this recovery suggesting much stronger productivity performance and thereby stronger real gdp growth moreover the growth of investment consumer spending and job creation during this recovery also imply that the pace of overall economic growth in this recovery has been stronger than officially reported the big idea ii wage gains picking up pace via goldman sachs while the large cumulative decline in labor market slack is broadly acknowledged there remains a widespread belief that wages are not picking up looking across a range of indicators we do see quite compelling evidence that wage growth has picked up although it remains below its estimated equilibrium level of percent our preferred tool for summarizing wage growth is our composite gs wage tracker i t has accelerated to a percent rate the fastest pace of the recovery so far our wage tracker continues to include the employment cost index average hourly earnings compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the atlanta fed s

"2016-05-05 20:28","Politico - Hillary forces target Bush donors","PaustenbachM@dnc.org","KaplanJ@dnc.org"," hillary forces target bush donorsby ben white pm edtnew york hillary clinton s supporters in recent days have been making a furious round of calls to top bush family donors to try to persuade them that she represents their values better than donald trump multiple sources in both parties told politico the moves come as clinton and the democratic party try to take advantage of deep unease among establishment republicans on wall street and elsewhere with trump s emergence as the presumptive republican nominee top targets for the clinton team include people like woody johnson jeb bush s former finance chair and the owner of the new york jets in recent days bush s brother and father former presidents george h w bush and george w bush have said they plan to skip trump s nominating convention one person close to clinton said supporters of the former secretary of state drew up a list of wall street donors who supported jeb bush and other unsuccessful republican candidates months ago but wanted to wait until trump locked down the nomination before beginning to make the calls when you think about it there is no downside to making these calls including for hillary herself to make then this person said they may say no but they will talk to her for half an hour about their view of the world and probably say nice things when asked about her publicly and they might stay away from trump clinton spokesman josh schwerin did not deny the calls were happening there s no official outreach from the campaign but i would not be at all surprised if our supporters are doing it on their own one big clinton donor on wall street said that bush donors are prime targets and that we re a big tent potential sources of support for clinton could include people like jack oliver who also served as a top fundraiser for jeb bush both johnson and oliver did not respond to requests for comment the race for wall street cash will be intense trump said this week that while he would help fund a general election campaign that could cost well over billion for each candidate he will also seek donations on thursday trump named steven mnuchin head of private investment firm dune capital management and a former partner at goldman sachs as his national finance chairman mnuchin himself has donated to clinton in the past highlighting the politically ambidextrous nature of many wall street donors but mnuchin s hiring could open wall street doors for trump that might otherwise be closed making the clinton effort event more important two major bush donors who received calls from clinton supporters said they would not switch their allegiance to the likely democratic nominee despite misgivings about trump s ability to win and his rhetoric on trade immigration and government spending but both suggested it was a smart play for clinton supporters to try and peel off establishment republicans who might otherwise grudgingly support trump i got a call from a friend a hillary supporter and he said he d love to chat about what a disaster trump is said one major bush donor and bundler who declined to be identified by name then i got a call from another guy also a big democrat who said exactly the same thing i responded to one in an email and said i didn t really think trump was a disaster and i d be supporting him because hillary would be a bigger disaster it s smart that they are doing it but i don t know how much it will work this donor added that jeb bush would not likely direct his donors to help clinton in any way as much as jeb hates trump and he really does hate trump he doesn t want to help hillary in addition to both former presidents bush gop nominee mitt romney and nominee john mccain also plan to skip the gop convention in cleveland highlighting how splintered the republican party has become in the age of trump romney and the bush family have powerful fundraising networks that trump who recently announced his desire to tap traditional fundraising sources for the general election campaign is likely to try to exploit but clinton supporters are hoping to limit trump s ability to tap into that money anthony scaramucci co managing partner of skybridge capital and a former bush supporter who has been wooed by clinton s supporters said he would not be swayed into backing the democrat but that other republicans on wall street might be i m a loyal republican and i m going to stay with the republicans and to the extent i can be helpful to trump i will be but it s hard to see how the fundraising is going to flesh out for him they are six months behind he said scaramucci said he thought establishment republicans would break down into three camps loyalists who will donate and work for trump ostrich republicans who will stick their heads in the sand and not do anything and a small group that will vote and fundraise for clinton robert wolf an investment banker who helped raise wall street money for president barack obama in and and now backs clinton said he wasn t aware of an organized effort to target moderate republicans but he said it was only natural to expect organic efforts to reach out to some prominent reasonable republicans to see if they want to get involved with electing the secretary in interviews across wall street this week top executives who have supported both republicans and democrats in the past said they were not worried enough about trump at this point to get strongly behind clinton the theory going around the financial industry is that trump is likely to lose and that even if he wins the real estate magnate would be constrained by both congress and the judicial branch from executing many of his proposals on trade and immigration i m not worried about it at all the ceo of one large bank said this week trump is going to lose and we will all wake up after election day and things will be just like they ve been the last eight years with a democrat in the white house and republicans controlling congress another bank ceo who has supported politicians in both parties laughed when asked if there would be a massive exodus to clinton in the wake of trump emerging as the presumptive nominee first of all i don t think it would be helpful to her for a bunch of wall street people to come out in support he said and he s probably not going to win and if he did it would probably be ok but this executive added another thought that is now a driving motivation behind the clinton campaign s efforts to attract deep pocketed wall street donors for the general election effort there are risks with trump and you do need to do some contingency planning having him as the nominee is like playing around with the puck in front of your own net in hockey there is some danger there so far the nonchalant reaction to trump among executives is also reflected in the financial markets stocks are off slightly since trump s remaining rivals all dropped out but there has been no major reaction either in the u s or globally investors are much more focused on economic data the threat that the u k could leave the eurozone and central bank moves than they are on the campaign analysts say that could change if it looks like trump is closing in on clinton but for now there is no sign of panic about a president trump one reaction in the market is that whatever happens on the presidential side will not remove the gridlock in washington and little will happen in congress which means maintaining slow but steady growth with the fed doing much of the heavy lifting said mohamed a el erian chief economic adviser at allianz another factor that could make it harder for clinton to peel off gop donors is that some are holding out hope for a third party candidate to get in the race some are now looking to first term senator ben sasse a nebraska republican as potentially that option sasse has been highly critical of trump and wrote a lengthy essay on facebook thursday called for an adult candidate to enter the race i don t know that big republican donors are at that point of backing clinton yet said another big bush bundler who asked not to be identified by name some people are still nosing around to see if there s a third party option and the ben sasse piece today is getting a lot of email traffic clinton s outreach to moderate republicans is not without political risks for her especially as she contends with a rival bernie sanders who has based his campaign around the idea that she s too supportive of banks and too eager to compromise with republicans there s nothing that will hurt her more with the bernie sanders bill de blasio elizabeth warren wing of the party than aligning herself with wall street said gop donor gregory slayton but those risks are apparently outweighed by the need for money clinton bundler jay jacobs said he s reached out to a few of his republican friends who he knows to be anti trump to get them interested in hillary s campaign while jacobs said some have told him they intend to vote for clinton none have committed to donating to her yet another clinton fundraiser agreed the outreach was useful to clinton even beyond the need to collect money we re making sure anyone who wants to be part of this campaign can be part of this campaign including republicans who feel disenfranchised by donald trump this person said there s no question there ve been a lot of incoming calls from republicans ken vogel annie karni

get asked about trump the presumptive gop presidential nominee and when he did obama was ready â we are in serious times and this is a really serious job â obama said â this is not entertainment this is not a reality show this is a contest for the presidency of the united states â the remarks previewed a part of the obama clinton strategy against trump that he is untested and not ready for the white house and that the gop and media have fallen down on the job by failing to properly vet him the remarks also reflect the urgency obama feels about defeating trump keeping the white house in democratic hands no matter who became the republican nominee has always been an important goal for obama washington post liz slyafter months of unexpectedly swift advances the u s led war against the islamic state is running into hurdles on and off the battlefield that call into question whether the pace of recent gains can be sustained chaos in baghdad the fraying of the cease fire in syria and political turmoil in turkey are among some of the potential obstacles that have emerged in recent weeks to complicate the prospects for progress others include small setbacks for u s allied forces on front lines in northern iraq and syria which have come as a reminder that a strategy heavily reliant on local armed groups of varying proficiency who are often at odds with one another wonâ t always

much intact â he said during the conversation at the new york fedâ s ornate fortress in lower manhattan â i think weâ re still on track â the fed in recent months has faced some criticism that it

some surprises in store this week for senator charles e grassley the iowa republican who leads the judiciary committee and who has ignored calls to convene a hearing on the nomination as the senate returns from a week off democrats intend to step up efforts to make mr grassley the poster boy for refusing to act on president obamaâ s nomination of judge garland those efforts will include the release of a report critical of the work of the judiciary committee under mr grassley on wednesday senate democrats will host a news conference with a group of former grassley supporters brought in from iowa who have changed their views on the senator they will also highlight polls showing that mr grassley who was thought to be breezing to a seventh term has been hurt more than other republicans by his position on judge garland though he remains favored to win his race republicansthe hill jessie hellmannsen jeff flake r ariz said on sunday that his colleagues should approve president obama s

conservative rivals in the war over merrick garlandâ s confirmation suggesting that president barack obamaâ s closest allies in the supreme court battle have more bark than bite the constitutional responsibility project â which is taking the lead in the democratic pr push over the court â has spent about on two ads knocking sens rob portman of ohio and pat toomey of pennsylvania for stonewalling garlandâ s nomination according to two media tracking sources thatâ s a pittance compared to the koch affiliated judicial crisis network which has already spent million to bolster vulnerable republicans and attack moderate democrats for urging action on garland the muscular spending from gop backed groups shows how dug in conservatives are over their garland blockade and has helped keep almost all senate republicans moving in lockstep other than a series of perfunctory meetings with republicans parliamentary progress on garland has been completely stopped now with many senate races shifting from primaries toward the general election the battles for control of the senate and filling the supreme court seat have become tightly intertwined new york times jennifer steinhauersenator ted cruz of texas is expected to return to the capitol this week the last of four republican senators battered and beaten by donald j trump to trudge back to the world of meetings over cafeteria cod and roll call votes to name the national mammal but mr cruzâ s return is more fraught with curiosity than those of the other three senators rand paul of kentucky lindsey graham of south carolina and marco rubio of florida he made it the furthest winning states and coming tantalizingly close to pushing mr trump to a contested convention only to drop out on the same day the billionaire developer suggested that mr cruzâ s father had conspired with lee harvey oswald the partyâ s presumptive nominee had also insulted mr cruzâ s wife baselessly alluded to extramarital affairs and labeled him â lyinâ ted â now the man who helped create an outsider movement in national politics only to have it eat him alive by the co opter of that idea must decide which group among his fellow lawmakers to join will he stand with the hold your nose set as mr paul has done and support mr trump or join forces with â never trump â as senator graham did on friday and publicly decline

elections the state has been grouped in the vaunted class of early voting states joining iowa new hampshire and south carolina as the bellwethers that garner the most attention from presidential candidates and help winnow votersâ choices but for the third straight primary season nevadaâ s caucuses have been wracked by embarrassing procedural errors low turnout confusion among attendees and questions about the integrity of the process republican national committee members say thereâ s growing momentum behind an effort to strip nevada of its early place in line â handing it instead to either colorado or arizona â the long knives are out for nevada â said one rnc committeeman â nevada does nothing for us â the review of the stateâ s pecking order is likely to be just one piece of the gopâ s wholesale review of a nominating process that just produced one of the most acrimonious primary seasons in memory and ended with donald trump as the partyâ s nominee the hill jordain carneysenate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky is under increasing pressure to bring up a revised criminal justice bill despite staunch opposition from conservatives in his own caucus the republican leader has been careful not to take a side on the legislation even though his second in command sen john cornyn r texas is one of the billâ s chief supporters the normally tight lipped mcconnell will need to walk a fine line as he weighs his decision is it worth potentially netting another bipartisan victory ahead of the election â when republicans have to defend senate seats â if it would put divisions within his own party under a spotlight in addition to vocal pushback from a handful of gop senators â including firebrands such as tom cotton ark and ted cruz texas â it could put senate republicans on a collision course with donald trump the gopâ s presumptive presidential nominee not known for policy specifics hasnâ t weighed in on the senateâ s bill however his previous law and order leanings are at odds with the legislation the hill rebecca savranskynorth carolina gov pat mccrory r said the federal government gave the state an unrealistic deadline to respond to a letter informing him that the state s bathroom law violates the civil rights act they gave the ninth largest state in the united states three working days to respond to a pretty complex letter and to a pretty big threat mccrory said on fox news sunday we don t think three working days is enough to respond to such a threat mccrory said he asked for an extension on friday the justice department sent a letter to the governor that says the law violates protections against workplace discrimination based on sex it gave the governor until monday to confirm that the state will not comply with or implement hb many people in support of lgbt rights condemned the law in north carolina which requires transgender people to use public bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex mccrory said in an interview sunday that the justice department agreed to give a one week extension if the governor admits that the language in the bathroom law does discriminate wall street journal kristina petersonsen john mccain walked into ping inc â s headquarters on a campaign stop here last week and immediately thanked the cambodian and vietnamese immigrants who help manufacture its golf clubs â iâ m grateful that you all are here â he said â thatâ s what america is all about â minutes later the arizona republican reiterated his support for presumptive gop presidential nominee donald trump whose militant immigration stance has polarized voters particularly in border states such as arizona â i support the nominee of the party â mr mccain said while predicting the stateâ s voters would separate his record from the businessmanâ s provocative stances â iâ m running my own campaign and the people of arizona know me â mr mccain entered his campaign for a sixth senate term as the clear favorite in a state that has elected him for more than three decades but the partyâ s presidential nominee is now almost certain to be in the difficult position of running on the gop ticket below a man who has clashed with him on immigration national security torture and even diminished his time as a prisoner of war new york times alan blindergov pat mccrory of north carolina is expected to respond on monday to the justice departmentâ s warning that a new state law limiting the rights of transgender people is illegal after he and the federal government failed to reach an agreement that would have allowed him to postpone his reply mr mccrory said that he could not assent to the justice departmentâ s condition for a one week extension â an acknowledgment by him that the law is discriminatory â and would answer by p m on monday â iâ m not going to publicly announce that something discriminates which is agreeing with their letter because weâ re really talking about a letter in which theyâ re trying to define gender identity and there is no clear definition of gender identity â mr mccrory a republican who is seeking re election this year said on â fox news sunday â â itâ s the federal government being a bully â the governor said that he was â discussing all of our legal options all of our political options â and he appeared to rule out the possibility that he would take some kind of independent action to undo the law or at least limit its enforcement as some people have suggested new york times emmarie huettemanunfailingly punctual he enters the office without a word he shakes hands with staff members who rise hastily from their desks and studies the home state curios on the walls he is ushered in behind closed doors and within the hour he leaves as quietly as he came occasionally slipping out a back exit with his retinue then comes the statement from one republican senator after another i had a pleasant visit with judge merrick b garland he is an intelligent talented jurist however i cannot support considering his nomination to the supreme court with this tango of praise and rejection the once sacrosanct process of filling a supreme court seat has taken a surreal turn in the past even eyebrow raising nominees received a hearing and a vote but senate republican leaders have said for nearly two months that judge garland a relatively uncontroversial nominee will get neither white house officials have not blinked in this staring contest they have scheduled meetings with any senator who will return their messages â to date including republicans this to and fro has left judge garland broadly regarded as a leading legal mind looking a little like the earnest leaflet clutching visitors who hope to raise awareness for their cause and grab a

nominee democratsthe hill julian hattemthe fbi investigation swirling around hillary clintonâ s presidential run appears to have entered its final stages many of the former secretary of stateâ s top aides have been interviewed over the course of the last month and clinton herself is expected to answer investigatorsâ questions about her use of a private email server in the coming days or weeks former officials and legal experts say the democratic front runner s testimony will likely be the final puzzle piece for federal prosecutors and fbi investigators as they decide whether to file any charges over her use of a personal email server while secretary of state â this certainly sends the signal that they are nearing an end to their investigation â said steven levin a former federal prosecutor and current partner at the law firm levin amp curlett though fbi officials have said clinton is not the target of the probe they would want to be as prepared as possible before going in to interview her levin said washington post david weigelin the end it was the voters of indiana last week who effectively gave the country the outcome that had loomed for months the election will likely put hillary clinton who is disliked by a majority of voters against donald trump disliked by another and more intense majority of voters if the rise of trump has no obvious precedent neither does an election like this clinton whose buoyant favorable ratings in the state department convinced some democrats that she could win easily is now viewed as unfavorably as george w bush was in his close reelection bid trump is even less liked with negative ratings among nonwhite voters not seen since the campaign of barry goldwater â in the history of polling weâ ve basically never had a candidate

anybody anytime â she said on cbsâ s â face the nation â and i ve encouraged â all of â my assistants â to be â very forthcoming and i hope that this is close to being wrapped up â â so nobody said â hillary clinton we d like to sit down and talk to youâ from the fbi â host john dickerson asked â not at this point â clinton responded many of the former secretary of stateâ s top aides have been interviewed in the past few weeks as the fbi investigation appears to have entered its final stages clinton herself is expected to answer questions in the coming days or weeks clinton said she would tell voters concerned about the issues what she has said â for many many months â bloomberg ben brodydemocratic presidential front runner hillary clinton said she sees â a great roleâ for bernie

exited the race the former secretary of state continues to battle for her partyâ s nomination against the vermont senator who has taken several positions to her left on economic issues â obviously i m reaching out to democrats republicans independents all voters who want a candidate who is running a campaign based on issues â clinton said in an interview with cbsâ s â face the nationâ broadcast on sunday clinton said she and sanders have similar views on issues including raising the minimum wage and reining â in bad actors on wall street and in corporate america she said she wants to unify democrats around those issues â i see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party to move into not just november to win the election against donald trump but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and i share â she said new york times alexander burnshillary clinton said sunday that the f b i had not asked to interview her as part of its inquiry into her use of a personal email server as secretary of state but mrs clinton reiterated on cbsâ s â face the nationâ that she would make herself available to law enforcement officials as necessary the investigation into mrs clintonâ s email practices and her handling of classified intelligence has shadowed her presidential campaign and cnn reported last week that she was likely to be interviewed soon by the f b i mrs clinton said on sunday that no meeting had been requested or scheduled â no one has reached out to me yet â she said adding â i made it clear that iâ m more than ready to talk to anybody anytime and iâ ve encouraged all of my assistants to be very forthcoming â as she has done in the past mrs clinton said she had erred in setting up a private email server but said she â always took classified material seriously â but mrs clinton also sought to turn around the scrutiny she was facing arguing that it was time for the republican candidate donald j trump to face similar examination mr trump she noted had not released his tax returns as is customary for presidential candidates cnn julian zelizerthere are many reasons why democrats should feel good about the election now that donald trump is the republican nominee even before gop voters went for trump the electoral college math tended to favor the democrats republicans will be playing catch up trump has also deeply divided the republican party with many of the most prominent leaders refusing to endorse him usually when parties divide this badly they lose unlike almost any other republican in the current age of polarization trump has the potential to generate a backlash of republican voters against their own party causing them to either stay home on election day or even worse for the party consider voting for the democratic nominee yet with all of these advantages democrats should be extremely careful about becoming overconfident there are many reasons that democrats should fear trump and anticipate a campaign that is much closer and much tougher than they are expecting washington post anne gearanin the fight for the votes of suburban women there is no more representative place than loudoun county the ticket splitting bedroom community in swing state virginia that hillary clinton will visit monday â and no better foil for her argument perhaps than donald trump affluent suburban women are a key audience for clinton the democratic front runner as she seeks to use trumpâ s polarizing statements about women immigrants and others against him clinton will hold a discussion about jobs schools and other concerns in a bellwether county that narrowly supported president obamaâ s reelection in and helped elect a republican critic of obama rep barbara comstock to congress two years later comstock has disavowed trump but isnâ t backing clinton the presidential candidate is hoping that women who think much as comstock does about national security the role of

than all other candidates combined the democratic front runner has raised million in total from wall street of which was contributed in march alone according to a wall street journal analysis of fundraising data provided by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics the former secretary of state received of the donations from wall street in march up from last year and in january through

the race such as former florida gov jeb bush and florida sen marco rubio to mrs clinton in recent months politico austin wrightdemocratic presidential front runner hillary clinton explained her oft repeated line that donald trump is a â loose cannonâ in a pre taped interview with cbs newsâ â face the nationâ that focused much more on the presumptive gop nominee than democratic rival bernie sanders â being a loose cannon means saying that other nations should go ahead and acquire nuclear weapons for themselves â when that is the last thing we need in the world today â clinton said in the interview airing sunday â being a loose cannon is saying we should pull out of nato â the strongest military alliance in the history of the world and something that we really need to modernize but not abandon â clinton was referencing remarks trump has made suggesting japan and south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the united states to defend them against north korea trump has also questioned the continued existence of nato calling the nation alliance â obsolete â the hill kyle balluckdemocratic presidential front runner hillary clinton said in an interview broadcast sunday that republican criticism of presumptive gop presidential nominee donald trump is not â personalâ but â rooted inâ criticsâ â respect for the office â â i have to say the republicans

respect for the office and their deep concern about what kind of leader he would be â speaker paul ryan r wis last thursday said he is â just not readyâ to support trump who became the presumptive nominee with a win in indianaâ s primary knocking rivals ted cruz and john kasich out of the race other high profile republicans have vowed never to back the real estate mogul the hill rebecca

americans â his proposal to cut trillions in taxes for the top one percent would almost certainly come at the expense of working and middle class families americans just canâ t afford trumpâ s economic plans citizens for tax justice said under trump s proposed tax plan the top percent of americans would get percent of the tax cuts according to a release the center on budget and policy priorities said the presumptive gop nominee s plan would create extremely large and unprecedented tax cut windfalls for millionaires which would come almost certainly at the expense of low and middle income households trump said an interview broadcast sunday there will be changes to his tax plan after negotiations washington post david a fahrentholdhillary clintonâ s official campaign platform is now twice as long as â hamletâ seventy three thousand six hundred forty five words of policy ideas one hundred seventy four pages and growing but at its heart this wordy list amounts to a statement of clintonâ s confidence in two things the status quo and the federal bureaucracy the other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul american government clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts in many cases her plans involve adding small â but intricate â new tasks for the bureaucracy designed to make government smarter more generous and more just to crack down on wall street for instance clinton would expand a particular regulatory form the form already is pages long and can require up to hours to fill out if congress doesnâ t overhaul immigration clintonâ s plan is to allow undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help already busy bureaucrats â armed with guidelines that nobody has written yet â would make millions of new decisions about who can stay this approach says a lot about clintonâ s worldview after years in and around washington to her complexity is realism the hill evelyn rupertoil mogul t boone pickens slammed democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton for her saying she wants to move the country away from fossil fuels â iâ m amused when i hear last night hillary clinton says we are going to get rid of coal weâ re going to get rid of all fossil fuels â pickens said in an interview with radio host john catsimatidis that aired sunday â you want to stop the music at that point and say â look what are you going to replace it with â she has no idea â clinton has said the u s should â move awayâ from coal and all the other fossil fuels â you get rid of fossil fuels and youâ ll stop the world â pickens said â thatâ s the only thing thatâ s going to move that wheeler is diesel or natural gas â the hill harper neidigthe chairman of the philadelphia host committee for this summerâ s democratic national convention said supporters of presidential candidate bernie sanders have to â behave themselvesâ when the vermont senator loses the nomination during a radio interview with john catsimatidis ed rendell a former pennsylvania governor and democratic national committee chairman laid out his vision for how the convention would play out â i think itâ s gonna be a great convention but of course the key to it is the sanders people bernieâ s gonna have his name placed in nomination weâ re gonna have a roll call thereâ s gonna be a demonstration in support of bernie heâ s gonna lose the roll call â he said â his supporters have to behave and not cause trouble and i think they will and i think sen sanders will send them a strong message â sanders is trailing democratic front runner hillary clinton by total delegates clinton is just delegates from clinching the nomination washington post fred hiatti know the polls say donald trump cannot win but what if we are looking at the wrong poll question what if trumpâ s overwhelming negatives donâ t matter or to put it another way what if the countryâ s negatives matter more right now about in americans have an unfavorable view of trump and only percent view him positively but the country is faring even worse in the most recent average of polls calculated by realclearpolitics percent of americans think the nation is headed in the right direction and percent think we are heading down the wrong track so what if even voters who respect hillary clintonâ s competence reject her as the embodiment of business as usual and what if even voters who do not like trumpâ s bigotry or bluster care more that he will in their view shake things up sure these voters might tell themselves he may be crude or inconsistent or ill informed he may insult women and hispanics and other groups but itâ s part of a shtick he probably doesnâ t mean half of it heâ s just an entertainer the desire to send a message of disgust or disapproval in other words could lead voters to overlook discount wish away or excuse many trump sins bloomberg margaret talev and arit johnwith every pledge to unify the democratic party hillary clinton is acknowledging one of her biggest challenges between now and november getting millions of bernie sanders fans to give her their votes the clinton campaign is still trying to figure out exactly what sanders wants in exchange for rallying his supporters to her side in recent weeks heâ s suggested that clinton canâ t expect them to just fall in line but he hasnâ t enumerated exactly what he believes would draw them in he hasnâ t said which of his policy positions is most important for her to adopt or at least shift closer toward or what other moves she could make that would

the hill jonathan swanrepublican operatives are scouring the country for transcripts notes or secret recordings of hillary clintonâ s paid speeches to goldman sachs in hopes of finding damaging material for the general election clinton has rebuffed calls from bernie sanders to release the transcripts of her three speeches to the wall street giant which she delivered in to the tune of per appearance she has repeatedly said she will release the transcripts of her paid speeches when all the presidential candidates agree to do so republican opposition researchers have taken matters into their own hands aggressively seeking any information about the speeches including from goldman employees who were in the room ian prior the communications director for the well funded republican group american crossroads said information about the goldman sachs speeches could prove cataclysmic for the democratic party finding and releasing the transcripts â would be a heck of a way to outflank

program right there clintonâ s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story her team has never disputed that clinton as part of her contracts for the speeches required that they not be taped in any form the contracts also stated that the transcriptions would be kept solely in her possession while the hunt for the transcripts is on republican operatives acknowledge theyâ ve

presidential nominee to expect everyone to come together the day after the primary process ended it was a bit unrealistic manafort said in an interview on fox news sunday but frankly i m very pleased to say that it s happening even faster than we thought manafort said republican leaders in washington were saying a week ago there was going to be a contested convention when trump won the indiana primary last tuesday he added the race ended much sooner than anybody expected except maybe the people supporting donald trump following trump s win the candidate s former rivals ted cruz and john kasich ended their presidential bids so washington was in a little bit of an uncertain phase but it s a healing process that will happen over time manafort said speaker paul ryan r wis said last week

cillizzarepublicans have a major electoral map problem in november major donald trumpâ s victory last week in indianaâ s primary not only effectively sealed the gop nomination for the real estate billionaire but also brought into sharp relief how difficult it will be for any republican to get to electoral votes and beat hillary clinton to become the th president this fall start here eighteen states plus the district of columbia have voted for the democratic presidential nominee in every election between and add them up and you get electoral votes by contrast states have voted for the republican presidential nominee in each of the past six elections total them up and you get electoral votes there are two important takeaways from these facts the generic democratic nominee starts with an electoral vote lead of and the democratic nominee needs to find only votes beyond that reliable base to win the presidency politico eli stokolsit was as shocking as it was predictable after a year of slow motion build upâ the dramatic splitting apart of the grand old party in the hours after donald trump became its presumptive nominee when asked friday if the organization he now leads is officially trumpâ s party republican national committee chairman reince priebus responded with pithy double speak befitting this dystopian moment in our politics â itâ s the partyâ s party â priebus said whatever party priebus was speaking of is currently in tatters there is no more denying that trump will be the republican partyâ s presidential nominee but there is still plenty of denial when it comes to accepting the more fundamental issue at hand that the fractious coalition of conservatives that we used to know as the republican party is after a decade of fraying ties between the washington based establishment and its base is now comprised of two separate coalitions there are those mainstream conservatives still tethered to the party s ideological history of limited government free trade and a hawkish foreign policy and there is the conservative base that is increasingly resentful of elites of all stripes voters unmoored from ideology and drawn to trump s charisma

its press credentialing practices with foreign media giants regularly denied press access and even blocked from general admission meanwhile local outlets down to the high school level find there is plenty of room the freeze out is a source of aggravation for foreign reporters but not all of them are blocked and the decisions about who is in and who is out do not always match trumpâ s rhetoric indeed with journalists from russia france and germany all reporting freeze outs at the same time that qatari owned al jazeera and japanese television find their way in it appears trumpâ s press

it remains to be seen whether he will stick to the strategy that got him there or chart a different course in order to succeed in the general election in the first four days since his gop rivals

unitedhealth is the countryâ s largest health insurer it is not a dominant player in the marketplaces that the aca set up for individual insurance buyers it covers only about â percent of million marketplace participants united does not appear to have been very effective at competing to attract customers an urban institute study found that unitedâ s premiums tend to be higher than competitorsâ

michael p lynchconsistency emerson said is the hobgoblin of little minds perhaps no one in american public life channels this thought more than donald j trump he not only doesnâ t fear contradiction he embraces it and he is downright scornful of those little minds that are bothered by his performances mr trumpâ s willingness to be inconsistent â even in a single interview or the same speech â has baffled political strategists for months even more puzzling is his followersâ happy toleration of it it is as though the content of what mr trump says doesnâ t matter only the fact that he is saying it does but how could that be after all other candidates are seemingly held to different standards by their supporters and others they are held responsible for what they say a striking early example

rights to more than residents who have completed their felony sentences the lawmakers have no good legal case and worse such a suit would be affirming virginiaâ s racist history virginia is one of just four states â along with iowa florida and kentucky â that continue to impose a lifetime voting ban on people convicted of felonies in recent years both democratic and republican governors have worked to lift this burden either by streamlining the application process for individuals or trying to restore rights to specific classes of people like those convicted of nonviolent felonies mr

ever in recent memory but with all attention on a boisterous presidential race members of congress have managed to do a few things right lately a bipartisan group of senators announced a major criminal justice reform bill on april bringing congress a crucial step closer to repairing federal sentencing and prison policy critics point out that the bill is modest watered down from previous versions that would have eased penalties for more types of federal prisoners for the senators behind the bill however these compromises were necessary to bring in votes for the policy which would still do good focusing on nonviolent offenders the legislation would reduce penalties for low level drug crimes and give judges more leeway in sentencing minor players in major drug rings for example would be eligible for lesser sentences the bill would also allow some federal prisoners to earn early release by completing prison programs designed to curb recidivism for better or for worse the bill would not empty the nationâ s prisons and it would not eliminate the appalling treatment of some inmates in this country in large part because the federal government does not control state prisons which lock up many more people but the bill would deal with some of the excesses of the tough on crime attitude of previous decades washington post editorial boardthe intent of virginiaâ s ban on

finished serving their felony sentences when richmondâ s gop leaders embarked on their campaign to tighten voter id laws they could cite no widespread or credible problem with fraud at the polls today

caygle jennifer scholtes ryan hutchins and sara stefaninivictory lap no way it s infrastructure week that time of year when infrastructure advocates hold events around the country to persuade cajole beg lawmakers for more funding mt checked in with two major players in this week s festivities ed mortimer the u s chamber of commerce s executive director of transportation infrastructure and ed rendell former governor of pennsylvania both eds agreed despite last year s passage of a long term ish surface transportation bill the upcoming week is no time for celebration they talked about their thoughts on the fast act their hopes for this year s events and why the inauguration of president donald j trump might be a good thing for infrastructure fans post fast goals mortimer said that part of this year s mission is to make it clear how fast act funding is being implemented what does the fast act really mean we want to make sure congress understands that this bill does have an impact this year he said modest expectations rendell was pretty meh about the success of the fast act it s not even properly paid for it s mostly illusory he said and he knows that chances are nil that congress will take another major crack at infrastructure funding this year we re not optimistic for a home run which would be a massive year infrastructure program with billion in additional spending still rendell said he believes there s growing recognition among lawmakers about the need for investment even in congress they re starting to realize that something s got to be done he added the more incidents you have the more pipelines that blow up the more bridges collapse they re starting to have an impact building bridges literally the needs are still out there mortimer said citing the nearly bridges around the country that are considered structurally deficient without more funding that number isn t going to diminish anytime soon he added even with the fast act we d like to get to a point where that number is under under we ve gotta improve em teamtrump or teamhillary infrastructure s sitting pretty despite the fact that he s a staunch democrat rendell said he s feeling hopeful no matter which way the presidential election goes at least when it comes to infrastructure the three presidential candidates bernie hillary and donald they ve all indicated that infrastructure is high on their radar screen because of the need and because it s a significant job producer all three of them have said it s going to be a priority agenda item for them if they become president rendell said

tentative agreement to further elaborate how eu legislation fits with the icao s market system as pro europe s sara stefanini reports european ministers remain concerned that the icao market measure will prohibit countries or regions from setting up their own systems for curbing aviation emissions like the eu s emissions trading system which already covers emissions from flights within the bloc back at home the u s government is mulling the question of how to ensure that enough emissions are covered to make the program environmentally effective while balancing the needs of developing countries that haven t contributed to the bulk of airline related climate warming pollution our lauren gardner has the rundown the u s government and its domestic airline industry are largely in lockstep on how a global system should work both want to see flight paths between a nation that doesn t participate in the program due to its developing status and one that does exempted from offsetting requirements to avoid market discrimination an industry official closely following the talks told politico a hybrid approach u s interests also agree that the eventual offsetting system shouldn t be solely based on the sector s growth rate lauren writes instead they are urging icao to embrace a hybrid approach that shifts the offsetting burden onto individual airlines so they account for their own growth and corresponding emissions that way u s legacy airlines experiencing slower emissions growth than counterparts abroad wouldn t have to consistently bear a greater share of the offsetting burden seeking recourse after reports of discrimination after a slew of incidents involving airline passengers falsely accused of being terrorists muslim advocates and the naacp legal

delegate haul figures to be a mystery that could stretch all the way to the convention floor in cleveland this summer leading most pennsylvania polls by double digits the billionaire is a near lock to carry the delegates awarded to the winner of the statewide vote but the process is more complicated for the remaining that s because they are essentially elected on the honor system voters first select their preferred candidate that s the state wide vote then voters in each of the congressional districts pick three delegates for the convention many of those delegates have pledged their support to trump ted cruz or john kasich but the catch is that they are technically unbound and beholden to nobody not the voters candidates or republican party senatecaliforniathe first debate in california s sleepy u s senate campaign seemed to present a question who has the best chance of securing the second and final spot on the november ballot alongside atty gen kamala harris because harris ended the evening where she started firmly still in the driver s seat harris and rep loretta sanchez both democrats have the best chance at making it past the state s top two june primary to face each other in a general election the republican hopefuls used monday s debate to attempt to sully sanchez s record more than go after harris who leads all public opinion polls and had nearly million in the bank at the start of this month the orange county congresswoman was pressed by george duf sundheim about missing a slew of house homeland security committee meetings in moderators kept sanchez on the defensive asking about past remarks about native americans the vietnamese and regarding the number of muslims supporting a strict islamist state she adamantly denied she was anti muslim and dismissed the comments as being taken out of context while also saying no one had refuted her claim coloradostate officials said monday that u s senate candidate jon keyser failed to collect enough signatures to earn a place on the june primary ballot a stunning blow that threatens to sink a campaign once hyped as the best in the republican field under state rules senate candidates who choose to petition their way onto the ballot must gather signatures from or more voters in each of colorado s seven congressional districts at least in all keyser fell short by signatures in colorado s rd district according to the colorado secretary of state s office which reviewed his petition the rd district is one of the state s largest and comprises most of western colorado keyser s campaign plans to protest the decision and has five days to do so the signatures he submitted overall allowed him to clear the threshold in the six other districts floridathe field to replace marco rubio in the senate is a crowded one but you wouldn t know it from the campaign s first debate monday night two of the seven candidates for the open seat u s reps alan grayson d orlando and david jolly r indian shores faced off in orlando debating economics abortion the environment and campaign finance the time spent on campaign finance allowed both candidates to highlight centerpieces of their campaigns jolly has been riding a wave of good publicity for hours following a minutes report sunday on legislation he proposed called the stop act it would ban federal elected officials from personally asking for money this weekend s broadcast showed images of members of congress dialing for contributions in what jolly called sweatshop phone booths indianakansasrep mike pompeo said monday he won t challenge sen jerry moran in a republican senate primary in kansas then took several nasty and barely disguised swipes at moran in a lengthy statement to supporters pompeo a republican from wichita said there isn t enough time to run an effective senate campaign this year the window for our kind of campaign is closed he wrote but there are several apparent references to moran in pompeo s statement it is absurd to defend one s record in the senate by telling constituents how many town halls you ve held pompeo s statement said it s the difference between motion and progress listening lacks value if no actions follow pompeo said he considered a race because moran said he might consider merrick garland for the u s supreme court a statement moran quickly withdrew pompeo as i watched this waffling up close i began to contemplate a senate run marylandat first glance the democratic primary for a us senate seat in maryland looks eerily similar to the party s national contest between hillary clinton and bernie sanders on one side there s an establishment candidate rep chris van hollen who has been in politics since the early s defines progressivism by legislation passed rather than promises made and touts wonky policy papers and bills on the campaign trail on the other there s a challenger from the left rep donna edwards who appeals to a national progressive audience with big picture rhetoric rather than nitty gritty deal making but this contest doesn t align neatly with the narrative of the clinton sanders face off rather than a clash of ideologies the maryland race has become partly a battle of identity politics van hollen is a white guy and edwards is an african american woman and if van hollen wins the takeaway might be that this element of the race trumped the ideological component the contest has been close although van hollen seems to have built a lead in the final stretch according to polls if tuesday s vote bears out those surveys it will fulfill the long expected script for the race nevada republican jon keyser did not qualify for the republican senate primary in colorado the state s chief elections officer said monday prompting keyser s campaign to announce that it would take legal action to get him on the ballot we are confident that we secured the necessary number of signatures to appear on the ballot keyser spokesman matt connelly said we will be pursuing legal action to ensure thousands of coloradans are not disenfranchised colorado senate candidates are required to gather valid signatures from each of the state s seven

"2016-05-10 07:17","Wall Street: Trump's debt policy smacks of bankruptcy","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," wall street trump s debt policy smacks of bankruptcyby ben white am edtnew york donald trump has a debt problem twice in the last five days the presumptive republican nominee has said things about dealing with the trillion federal debt that left wall street terrified republicans dumbfounded and democrats licking their chops the trouble for trump began thursday on cnbc when he appeared to suggest that as president he would not repay all the u s debt owed to creditors asked if the u s should repay its debts in full or ask creditors to take less trump said i would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal financial experts instantly leaped on the comments suggesting that trump who is no stranger to bankruptcy as an executive would allow the u s to default for the first time in its history an event which could send interest rates soaring and tank the u s economy trump went on cnn on monday morning to clear things up of course he would never allow the u s to default anyone who suggested such a thing must be crazy what trump meant to say was that if interests rates rise he would consider buying back existing u s debt at a lower prices as interest rates rise the price of existing debt goes down in other words we can buy back debt at a discount people said i wanted to go and buy debt and default on debt these people are crazy trump said but then he landed himself right back in the soup this is the united states government trump said first of all you never have to default because you print the money i hate to tell you that comment that the u s can simply pay back its trillions of dollars in debt by printing a ton more money drove wall street crazy again and prompted a conference call from top democrats to rip trump as completely unglued on the economy trump is not exactly wrong on either front the u s can and does buy back existing debt and replace it with cheaper debt but trump s initial comments certainly sounded more like negotiating with creditors as one does in a bankruptcy proceeding to accept less than they are owed something wall street associates with places like puerto rico argentina and greece and not with the united states of america which has a triple a credit rating and maintains the world s reserve currency and the federal reserve can and does print money in massive amounts and can do so in ways that make existing debt burdens both for individuals and the government less onerous but presidents treasury secretaries and federal reserve chairs would never go out and say they plan to create inflation to deal with the debt to do so could dramatically change the way investors view the u s and cause rates to skyrocket and other nations that have tried to inflate their way out of debt have often failed spectacularly if there is ever an example of how dumb it is to print money to handle debt i m in a country which has had had to learn that the hard way more than once said david kotok chief investment officer at cumberland advisors speaking from a conference in argentina it s a stupid idea you don t discharge debt especially u s dollar debt by printing money you do print money to create liquidity for banking systems in trouble but you don t print money to cheapen your debt which is the reserve currency of the world other wall street analysts said while the basic concepts trump highlighted buybacks and money printing are common the fact that they came from a presidential candidate was shocking we ve basically renegotiated existing debt in the past and we certainly do print money said jim paulsen chief investment officer at wells capital these concepts are far from odd but to say them as a presidential candidate is what is so striking to me and frightening for a president to say these kinds of things publicly would have the opposite effect you would want in that they would put the economy into recession democrats also jumped all over trump s comments on the debt in a hastily arranged conference call on monday jake sullivan top policy adviser to likely democratic nominee hillary clinton and gene sperling an outside adviser to the campaign and a former top aide to presidents barack obama and bill clinton ripped into the likely gop nominee sperling said it was shocking at a time when our country is celebrating the economic foresight of alexander hamilton that the presumptive candidate for president donald trump is openly advocating that the united states no longer honor percent of its debt or protect our full faith and credit sperling added that trump was basically putting america in the position of saying i m going to overleverage and then if things look really terrible and people fear that our debt will be worth less i will come in and try to pay a discount that s not clever that is one of the most dangerous economic things we ve seen some conservative republicans also reacted sharply to trump s comments which lie far outside the mainstream of gop economic policy generally republicans have favored attacking the debt through spending cuts and faster economic growth rather than manipulating it through buybacks creditor negotiations or money creation these people also criticized trump for appearing to try and influence policy at the federal reserve which is supposed to operated independent of political pressure from the white house this is yet another big misstep what he is implying is the era of fed independence is over said douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum and a former official under president george w bush i no longer know what trump does and doesn t know about managing the debt but i m pretty sure i don t trust his judgment i also worry about the international community watching this daily they have reason to be nervous about him holtz eakin added that he would recommend trump refrain from this kind of commentary until he can spend more time learning about the subject if i were advising him i d say let s take a day or two off of this and talk about beauty pageants or something else you

demo","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edtandy slavitt sits down for an exclusive interview with pulse s new podcast and tom coburn thinks the fda has grown so unnecessarily strict it wouldn t even approve aspirin today but first what s in cms s monumental physician payment rule what s in macra cms on wednesday proposed its highly anticipated changes to medicare physician payment the biggest reforms to doctor reimbursement in years the agency s focus introducing more flexibility for physicians who say they re over regulated and over measured while further nudging them towards models designed to reimburse them for high value care pulse pulled out five major takeaways from the page announcement acos in track of the medicare shared savings program won t qualify as an advanced alternative payment model more for pros cms outlined three standards that will be used to determine whether providers are assuming more than nominal financial risk a crucial metric for determining eligibility as an advanced alternative payment model more for pros to qualify as an advanced alternative payment model clinicians will have to comply with a number of health it requirements percent of clinicians must used certified ehrs by and percent by meanwhile cms will sunset its meaningful use program as expected and replace it with the new advancing care information program which is intended to offer more flexibility for instance the aci program would not require all or nothing electronic health record measurement mips eligible clinicians will still be on aggressive upgrade timelines for their health it by clinicians will have to use edition certified products only and will have to perform requirements which correlate with meaningful use stage what they re saying bullish the american medical association our initial review suggests that cms has been listening to physicians concerns said ama president steven stack in particular it appears that cms has made significant improvements by recasting the ehr meaningful use program and by reducing quality reporting burdens bearish the american hospital association we are deeply disappointed by cms s narrow definition of alternative payment models which could have a chilling effect on providers ability to experiment with new patient centered value driven payment models said aha s tom nickels today s rule fails to recognize the significant resources and risk assumed by the highly motivated early adopters of alternative payment models exclusive andy slavitt on macra and more the cms acting administrator sat down with pulse for the debut of our brand new podcast pulse check slavitt shared thoughts on the new physician payment rule the future of obamacare pilots why drug prices could be the top priority for his successor and much more three fun slavitt tidbits we learned from the podcast he estimates he gets comment letters per week from capitol hill alone he thinks health care is two words not one his willingness to be direct and honest on twitter freaks out his colleaguesthis is thursday pulse where we re bidding good morning to a certain cms administrator who confessed he uses pulse to determine whether it s a good day to get out of bed we d propose he rise and shine and if that turns out to be a punitive recommendation he can always let us know in the comment period tips to ddiamond politico com or ddiamond on twitter with help from sarah karlin smith sarahkarlin the bipartisan push to kill the part b demo republican lawmakers are planning to ask hhs as soon as

democrats are joining them now too the demonstration project is awful sen richard burr told pro s jennifer haberkorn and sarah karlin smith we ve spent a decade driving things out of the hospital and now all of a sudden they re reverting back to putting it all back into the hospital he said citing doctors concerns they will be driven out of business why democrats want significant changes all democrats on the senate finance committee signed on to a letter expressing their concerns with the program including how it will interact with other payment reform efforts and medicare demonstration projects we have heard numerous concerns from patients providers and other stakeholders about the model s potential to have unintended consequences on medicare beneficiaries access to care and physician administered drugs the democrats warn they also caution that while cmmi should initially implement focused demonstrations the part b demonstration proposes significant and complex changes that could affect up to percent of providers meet hillary clinton s top three health care advisors the trio of chris jennings neera tanden and ann o leary are the inner circle hoping to shape the policies guiding the democratic front runner into the white house pro s nancy cook reports clinton s known for cultivating small loyal circles of advisers and her top health care experts fit the bill jennings has guided clinton since her s health reform effort and clinton s relationships with tanden and o leary also date back to her husband s administration collectively their strategy centers on stressing clinton s bold and practical stance on health care the only politician left in the race who s vowed to preserve the affordable care act and improve upon it rather than start anew paul ryan wants to end obamacare s protection for pre existing conditions the house speaker on wednesday called for an end to the affordable care act s ban on underwriting for pre existing conditions arguing that there s a less expensive alternative to cover america s sickest patients let s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage so that they can get affordable coverage ryan said in a speech to students at georgetown university you dramatically lower the price for everybody else you make health insurance so much more affordable so much more competitive and open up competition percent that s the percentage of americans who say they or a family member have a pre existing medical condition like cancer diabetes or heart disease kaiser family foundation ceo drew altman points out senate to valeant apology not accepted valeant s executive suite on wednesday came prepared to publicly apologize for their price hiking tactics at the senate aging committee s drug price hearing but committee leadership was on the attack before the company s executives could even testify pro s sarah karlin smith reports as for turning over a new leaf i remain skeptical said ranking member claire mccaskill valeant hiked the price of sixteen of its drugs the last six months mccaskill added later in the hearing how can you sit here and say you are sorry why the senate was so unhappy lawmakers also didn t accept valeant s claims that its pricing tactics were just a small part of the company s business plan or that it had made efforts to provide patients and hospitals with discounts on its drugs we have yet to find any hospitals that have received those discounts chairwoman susan collins said your patient assistance program does not have a good track record and has been very difficult to navigate she added what s next for valeant a major shake up the company s planning to drop five long standing board members and add four new ones in an effort to change its ways the wall street journal reports the new board members are drawn from the pharma industry an unusual move for valeant given that it publicly derided pharma firms while trying to position itself as an

cures learn more here about the outcome of strong ip policies the selling of obama and obamacare writing in politico magazine mike grunwald details the never ending internal battle over the obamacare message that plagued white house media strategy in the early days of the administration and because top officials never settled on a single message the media strategy on the affordable care act constantly fluctuated as a result one month we d emphasize coverage the next month cost the next month taking on the insurers former spokesman reid cherlin said the more polling you do and the more of a beating you take the more you try different things and you lose the narrative media struggles extended beyond pennsylvania avenue on twitter grunwald adds that hhs was furious at the white house and wanted a major advertising push to defend reform but white house aides didn t trust hhs and thought the less said the better politically growing number of dem voters want congress to build on aca that s according to this morning s kaiser family foundation tracking poll which found that percent of democratic voters now want congress to expand the law s scope rather than just leave it as is that s the highest level of support for aca expansion in at least a year and a significant increase from percent of respondents in december why the surge the foundation s analysts muse that the rhetoric around universal coverage in the democratic presidential campaign may be the chief culprit u s military will finally explain why it bombed a doctors without borders hospital that s according to nbc news which reportsthat the military on friday will release its investigation into the october bombing of a doctors without borders trauma center in afghanistan that killed at least people according to nbc s report the military will offer a detailed timeline and release a heavily redacted version of the investigation several service members faced administrative punishment but not criminal chargessome states pay more than double what others do for health care that s according to a new analysis from the health care cost institute the latest report to quantify the massive cost variation in the u s health care system the authors acknowledge that the existence of regional cost variation is widely known but say they re still puzzled by the forces behind them and they call on regulators

the highest health care prices relatively alaska percent higher than the national average wisconsin percent higher north dakota percent higher states with the lowest health care prices relatively florida percent lower arizona percent maryland percent manhattan institute offers prescription on cancer drug reforms the free market think tank is out with a new report on using precision medicine to improve outcomes and value ahead of its a m briefing on capitol hill today the report s chief argument that a series of regulatory reforms and emerging technologies would allow fda to more quickly bring drugs to market better reward innovative drug makers and lower costs for patients and providers for instance the institute concludes that the growing focus on cancer genomics won t only lead to new breakthroughs in targeted medicine but improve oncology pricing too the rise of precision medicine databases and analytical tools that can tell doctors and patients how best to match a specific drug with a specific patient s disease may well help solve the problem of drug price sticker shock the report reads coburn no fan of fda at a small dinner on wednesday retired sen tom coburn a manhattan institute adviser said that the agency is missing opportunities to approve innovative drugs because it s grown too focused on relatively inconsequential risks aspirin would not be approved

that the white house said is a woefully inadequate response to the threat posed by the virus the republican backed bill approved mostly on party lines reprograms million in unspent ebola funds and another million from hhs administrative budget toward zika preparedness however the package only runs through september cole more zika money will come rep tom cole chairman of the house appropriations labor hhs subcommittee told reporters wednesday that he will provide very substantial funding for zika in the next appropriations bill which covers the fiscal year that begins oct that funding would come on top of the million that the house approved last night he declined to give an exact dollar figure but said it will be very comparable to the billion package the senate advanced this week the senate s plan covers both fiscal years the different timetables could be an issue if the house and senate go to conference with separate funding packages democrats meanwhile want to fund the entirety

"2016-04-27 20:38","Trump Fails to Impress Foreign Policy Experts","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org","politico michael crowleyin his address to an elite invitation only washington foreign policy audience wednesday donald trump promised that as president he would restore a coherent vision to america s role in the world but across the ideological spectrum and even among natural allies trump s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that trump is up to the job it struck me as a very odd mishmash said doug bandow a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian cato institute who shares many of trump s beliefs about scaling back america s role abroad he called for a new foreign policy strategy but you don t really get the sense he gave one trump s speech was lacking in policy prescriptions and its strident rhetoric masked a lack of depth said robert bud mcfarlane a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan who attended the speech speaking at washington s mayflower hotel trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign including promises to cut better trade deals with china swiftly defeat the islamic state rebuild the military and reduce the expense america incurs in upholding international security from europe to asia trump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies he also unveiled a new theme saying that the u s would finally have a coherent foreign policy based on narrow self interest economic gain and global stability but trump offered few specifics about his strategy focusing on the alleged disasters created by past presidents and a foreign policy establishment who frankly don t know what they re doing even though they may look awfully good writing for the new york times or talking on television trump said he would surround himself with talented experts and new people to help him chart a global strategy but even though he said on msnbc s morning joe earlier in the day that i ll be naming them today he did not do so the audience was heavier on celebrity journalists like bob woodward and jake tapper than on the sort of prominent foreign policy thinkers and former government officials typically present at similar appearances by presidential candidates trump has largely been shunned by foreign policy veterans of past republican administrations more than members of whom recently signed an open letter saying they would not join his administration some have threatened to vote for hillary clinton over trump in november one notable figure sitting in the front row as trump repeated his call for better relations with moscow i believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia from a position of strength is possible common sense says this cycle of hostility must end trump said was russia s ambassador to washington sergey kislyak trump made some intriguing points but we need to understand what is meant in the implementation kislyak told politico after the speech it needs to be started carefully also in attendance was a trump foreign policy adviser walid phares a lebanese maronite christian who applauded vigorously when trump said the u s had left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide the address was hosted by the national interest magazine an intellectual journal not often spotted on trump s private jet but which promotes the so called realist school of foreign policy which holds that the u s should pursue narrowly defined security interests with little concern for missions like promoting democracy or overthrowing repressive regimes some of trump s speech aligned with realist theory including his disdain for u s interventions in the arab world and what he called the dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy under a trump presidency he said no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries but experts called trump s speech rife with internal tensions he declared that america first would be the major and overriding theme of his presidency moments before hailing america s role in world war ii which was opposed by the isolationist america first movement of the early s he trashed president barack obama for failing to follow through with his threatened september air strikes in syria while also lamenting the chaos that has followed u s military interventions in iraq and libya and trump vowed to mend ties with u s allies who are fearful that america is withdrawing from the world while insisting they pay more for their own security there s just no way to reconcile these two statements it certainly won t reassure anyone internationally or anyone within the republican foreign policy establishment wright added but trump is also trying to broaden his electoral support and some analysts said that the view of elites matters less than the populist soundbites about u s military and economic strength repeating on cable television wednesday afternoon and evening trump s complaint that america s nato allies are not paying their fair share to support the european security alliance does echo at least one influential foreign policy thinker barack obama who in his address in hanover germany this week scoldedeuropeans for being complacent about their own defense obama has also complained about free riders from europe to the arab middle east enjoying the benefits of u s protection without spending or risking more themselves obama has not however explicitly threatened to let these countries defend themselves as trump did wednesday not everyone was totally dismissive of the manhattan mogul s appearance including zalmay khalilzad a former u s ambassador and national interest board member who introduced trump on wednesday he offered a coherent framework not totally outside the mainstream american foreign policy debate said khalilzad who held several senior foreign policy posts in the george w bush administration including ambassador to iraq and to afghanistan of course he added expectations were low trump also left the hawkish republican right deeply unimpressed republican senator lindsey graham of north carolina a former presidential rival to trump issued a series of derisive tweets during the address which he said was full of disconnected thought and demonstrated a lack of understanding of threats we face ronald reagan must be rolling over in his grave graham tweeted michael hirsh contributed to this report"

search yes black lives matter movement finds influencing contest a challenge the protest organization drew no mention during the second gop presidential debate there were more than words uttered during the three hour republican presidential primary debate wednesday night none of them were black lives matter for more than a year the nation has been locked in a passionate discussion about race and policing driven by the killing of unarmed black men and women by police officers but as underscored wednesday night the movement that has funneled thousands of protesters into american streets prompted new scrutiny of law enforcement and forced democratic presidential candidates into several stumbles on the trail has yet to receive significant attention in the gop race how to best influence the presidential contest remains a challenge for activists and organizers working under the black lives matter banner in part because different factions of the movement disagree starkly over the best way to do so those tactical disagreements will be front and center this weekend during the congressional black caucus foundation s annual policy conference which features an expansive list of panels with participants as diverse as protesters and policymakers who have risen to prominence during the current protest movement the real goal is to drive the narrative around the presidential debate said nick mosby the baltimore city council member who represents the neighborhood where riots erupted this spring after the death of freddie gray of an injury he suffered while in police custody and that s really hard several protest groups have vowed to continue staging demonstrations at candidates public appearances a tactic that has drawn significant criticism in political and protest circles other activists including deray mckesson who is perhaps the nation s most widely recognized protester linked to the movement have focused on policy meetings pressuring candidates to engage on the details of policing and criminal justice on wednesday mckesson was among activists who met separately with sen bernie sanders i vt and valerie jarrett a senior adviser to president obama to discuss campaign zero their policing and criminal justice policy platform the movement have brought issues of police and criminal justice to the forefront in ways that we haven t seen in decades mckesson said all of the campaigns will continue to need to think deeply about the issues that the unrest has brought to the fore and on friday a new bipartisan group comprising young black lawmakers and public professionals will arrive in washington to meet with the democratic and republican national committees with the hope of succeeding where they think the young activists have fallen short thus far getting the gop candidates to take policing reform seriously the republican candidates are not the only ones under pressure some of the movement s biggest headlines of the summer came when members interrupted democratic candidates sanders and martin o malley during a liberal policy conference organized in phoenix by the group netroots nation our group was pretty much solidified after the netroots situation said ashley bell who is one of two chairs of leaders of america an alliance of young black elected officials and policymakers that is evenly composed of democrats and republicans but the disruptive protests were not an unqualified success they drew criticism from many on both sides of the political aisle causing some who want to see policing and criminal justice reform to worry that the protest movement would not be taken seriously by presidential candidates there was a lot of concern that we needed to make sure the candidates had a venue and marketplace to talk about these issues said bell a republican and former county commissioner in hall county ga the next president might not be african american if not we need to make sure the next president understands the issues that affect black communities bell said his group has held preliminary policy talks with the presidential campaigns of sen rand paul r ky and gov scott walker r wisc the group has also invited the candidates to a presidential forum in november at allen university in south carolina an rnc official confirmed wednesday that during the meeting friday will present policy proposals on policing and criminal justice that are being considered for inclusion in the republican party s party platform we definitely have a long way to go said aja brown the mayor of compton calif who is in washington this week we have to get to that moment where all of the candidates are really discussing the issues at the forefront of the national headlines so we can have a candid conversation about race education and economic opportunity in two debates that stretched for a combined five hours the candidates in the republican presidential field were asked just one question about what some on the left consider a new civil rights movement it was wildly disappointing for them to have a three hour debate wednesday and not once bring up these issues which have completely altered the national conversation mckesson said on wednesday night the only time the word police was uttered by a candidate was during a response by paul about medical marijuana the most memorable of just a handful of exchanges about criminal justice reform involved jeb bush s apology to his mother for smoking marijuana years ago our country is at a fork in the road said chelsi henry a conservative columnist for ebony magazine and a member of these issues have come up during presidential elections before what makes it so unique this time around is that we want to see more than a talking point that has been the message delivered consistently by mckesson and the others who came to prominence as activists after the fatal police shooting of michael brown in ferguson mo in that message was the focus of their sit down with sanders on wednesday the activists who met with sanders were mckesson johnetta elzie brittany packnett and samuel sinyangwe the team behind campaign zero as well as erika totten a washington based activist and organizer and martinez sutton the brother of rekia boyd an unarmed black woman who was shot and killed by an off duty police officer in chicago in after that session mckesson elzie and packnett went to the white house and met with jarrett and roy austin jr the deputy assistant to the president for urban affairs in a meeting that included phillip agnew of the dream defenders and jamye wooten of baltimore united for change we ve seen broad engagement with campaign zero at all levels of the politics mckesson said i m encouraged and i m hopeful that the conversation with the white house is a beginning and will result in tangible things that affect these issues the conversation only matters if it informs practice that impacts people s lives campaign zero has earned the praise of prominent democratic operatives and some activists but it has also drawn the skepticism of some activists not involved in it highlighting significant divisions among the young activists there is no doubt in my mind that our country must be aggressive in addressing institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system sanders said in a statement after his meeting with the activists i look forward to a continuing dialogue with campaign zero and other voices from communities of color to address deeply entrenched racial and economic problems in our country sanders and hillary rodham clinton the front runner in the democratic presidential race are aggressively courting black voters who were crucial to the obama coalition it s not going to be easy to get our votes patrisse cullors another police reform activist said in a previous interview but if they re feeling compelled to meet with the people who have been leading the black lives matter movement then things are headed in the right direction washington post blogs september dozens arrested in ferguson protests protesters arrested outside the federal courthouse face charges of unreasonably obstructing the usual use of an entrance

on wednesday when he tweeted out to his followers that the man who fatally shot a tv reporter and cameraman in virginia was white mckesson quibbled with initial reports that the shooter who had not been identified at the time was a disgruntled ex employee the activist who began touring the country as an organized protester after the michael brown shooting last year appeared to believe that the shooter was white he compared the initial reports to how muslims are characterized as terrorists following similar incidents cid image jpg d af b d mckesson deleted the tweet after the shooter was identified as vester lee flanagan a year old black man he later acknowledged his incorrect tweet laying blame on false reports but did not offer an apology ironically earlier on wednesday mckesson appeared on c span s washington journal to talk about his activism and the black lives matter movement and scolded a critical caller for not getting her facts correct the caller argued that mckesson should focus more on cases of so called black on black crime mckesson himself has been accused of playing fast and loose with the facts in the past in many of the cases he s protested from the michael brown case to freddie gray s death to sandra bland s mckesson has made claims to his large twitter following that turned out to be false hey team can we please vet deray mckesson to act as a surrogate

"2016-05-20 20:21","Sanders outraised Clinton in April after all","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," sanders outraised clinton in april after allby isaac arnsdorf and kenneth p vogel pm edt hillary clinton entered this month with a healthy million in the bank but her campaign did not take in more money than bernie sanders in april contradicting earlier assessments and calling into question suggestions that her fundraising had overtaken his small dollar fundraising juggernaut clinton s main campaign committee directly received million last month compared to million raised by sanders campaign according to reports filed friday afternoon with the federal election commission sanders actual tally is slightly more than his campaign indicated earlier this month when it put out a news release boasting of raising million a sanders campaign source said the discrepancy resulted from the challenges of tallying huge numbers of small donations meanwhile clinton s tally is slightly less than the million that her campaign touted earlier this month the discrepancy in her fundraising figures arises from the accounting techniques of a joint committee called the hillary victory fund that her campaign formed with the democratic national committee and state parties in addition to the million transferred by the hillary victory fund to clinton s campaign committee clinton s aides counted towards its april tally million in expenses paid out by the fund for the clinton campaign s share of joint fundraising costs those funds were spent on behalf of her campaign even though the money that paid for them was never transferred to the campaign the clinton campaign says it has been assessing its finances that way since the formation of the victory fund last year a spokesman said rejecting a suggestion that it s an effort to pad its bottom line but in april the higher tally that resulted from the accounting method led to a slew of headlines including in politico about clinton outraising sanders for the first time which was seen as significant since sanders small dollar online fundraising prowess has been a key advantage over clinton while sanders still raised far more than clinton from small donors in april million to million his overall fundraising dropped substantially from the previous two months as clinton closed in on the democratic party nomination clinton s campaign appeared to be preparing for the general election spending far less than sanders she dropped million in april compared to million for him sanders spent almost twice as much on media and payroll despite a slightly smaller staff as well as more on online advertising and direct mail as a result sanders entered this month with only million in the bank compared to clinton s million clinton also made slight inroads with small donors who have favored her rival percent of the contributions to the campaign in april were in amounts less than compared with percent across the cycle about percent of her total income came from donors who hit the limit and can t give again and her campaign raised another million for various democratic party committees through the victory fund though it has been criticized for purporting to help rebuild state parties while actually funneling cash to the dnc the state parties in arkansas and tennessee reported receiving each from the victory fund on april but transferring the same amount to the dnc on the same day continuing an earlier pattern of shuffling funds sanders also has a joint fundraising committee but hasn t used it much to view online "

report","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edtthe u s obesity rate has increased by nearly percent in the past two decades and the nfl hits back after a damaging house report but first a mental health reform bill is back after months of being stalled in committee house e amp c to mark up mental health bill in june after months of being in limbo the house s major mental health reform bill will get a full energy and commerce committee markup next month aides tell pro s brianna ehley it was six months ago when the e amp c health subcommittee approved rep tim murphy s bill h r after a grueling hour markup during which lawmakers sparred over patient privacy rights and court ordered outpatient treatment programs cost was also a major issue aides said chairman fred upton murphy and others are working out controversial elements and developing a manager s amendment that could satisfy most members insurer debt nearly doubles health insurers debt levels have nearly doubled since reaching billion in borrowed funds at the end of last year according to an analysis by a m best company the primary driver is industry consolidation with anthem s planned takeover of cigna and aetna s pending acquisition of humana poised to further increase debt levels but obamacare s exchanges are another major factor a m best s analysts point out that programs designed to protect insurers entering the new marketplaces typically don t pay out right away in addition there s been some timing fluctuations in payment of direct government subsidies therefore health insurance carriers offering exchange products had to utilize more of their own liquid funds to pay claims while recording sizeable receivables for future payments from the government the report notes this is

committee got it wrong when they accused the nfl of trying to influence a government study on concussions according to an e amp c staff report nfl officials tried to quietly persuade the national institutes of health to yank a million research grant for dr robert stern a prominent boston university researcher who has been vocally critical of the league and its approach to the dangers of concussions but while the nfl acknowledges that it raised concerns it says that the committee s allegations aren t true and the funding decisions were made through appropriate channels it is deeply disappointing the authors of the staff report would make allegations directed at doctors affiliated with the nfl head neck and spine committee without ever speaking to them an nfl spokesperson told politico house dipping into hhs macra fund to pay for zika that s according to a letter from hhs secretary sylvia mathews burwell to the house appropriations committee as first reported by the morning consult the house s million package to fight zika virus is offset with about million of leftover ebola funding and million of hhs funds most of which would come from the nonrecurring expenses fund according to burwell the agency had planned to use million in the fund to implement medicare s new physician payment law the nonrecurring expenses fund is often used by hhs to support capital investments and other infrastructure items if the house package stands it would be the first time that congress has dipped into the nonrecurring expenses fund to offset other initiatives what hhs says the nonrecurring emergency fund supports vital initiatives across hhs an hhs spokesperson told pulse secretary burwell s letter lays out the real potential costs to the american people and to

p m today witnesses include an nih expert several children s hospitals and the childress institute for pediatric trauma why do we need a pediatric trauma caucus we ve all seen stories of head injuries concussions and trauma in professional sports in the news but most people don t know that this is also a very serious issue for our children rep richard hudson a caucus co founder tells pulse in the united states pediatric trauma is the number one killer of children a message from national community pharmacists association ncpa more transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen bipartisan legislation h r would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations visit www ncpanet org pharmacyaccess ema pulls black triangle warning on rx smoking cessation drug a study published last month in the lancet found that pfizer s chantix and other prescription drugs to help smokers quit don t carry a significant increased risk for suicide or less drastic psychiatric side effects the results prompted the european medicines agency on monday to lift its requirement for a black triangle warning on the drug s label the ema version of fda s most serious black box caution chantix had been dogged in the decade since it was introduced by anecdotes of violence and suicide associated with its use but that was undercut by the large scale study requested by the fda that compared the drug head to head with placebo and nicotine patch treatments pfizer has said the data show that the black box warning is no longer warranted in the united states but the fda has yet to act lawsuit plaintiffs commission damaging fitbit study back in january plaintiff s firm lieff cabraser filed a class action lawsuit against fitbit charging the wearable tech company with shipping inaccurate heart rate monitors the plaintiffs received a bit of scientific validation monday with the unveiling of a study commissioned by them that purports to show major inaccuracies with the heart rate tracking of fitbit s charge and surge devices when compared with an electrocardiogram during exercise the study claims the charge s heart rate differed from the electrocardiogram by a mean of beats per minute while the surge differed by beats researchers and users have long faulted fitness trackers for their inaccuracy for example some iowa state professors dinged the industry for their poor calorie tracking while bloggers have often taken the devices to task gates foundation ceo progress on key health issues sooner than you think in a new letter sue desmond hellman writes that the foundation is making dramatic progress in combating tobacco and neglected tropical diseases around the world for example desmond hellman cites improvements in fighting sleeping sickness a parasitic disease transmitted by the tsetse fly in sub saharan africa and with a near percent fatality rate if untreated in there were nearly cases of sleeping sickness in uganda she writes by that number had dropped to this year we ve seen only four bipartisan policy center on healthy aging in america the organization on monday announced new recommendations on how to integrate health care and housing for seniors for example the center suggests that cms launch an initiative to coordinate care for seniors living in publicly assisted housing and scale an existing demonstration to coordinate care at home for frail seniors given the risk of patient falls billion that s the approximate annual health care cost resulting from seniors falls about one in three seniors fall per year jill biden in boston the second lady will visit the patientslikeme headquarters this afternoon

for opioid addiction treatment act lifeboat which is intended to establish a permanent funding stream to provide and expand access to substance abuse treatment watch live correction monday s pulse said that physicians already have participated in cms s macra seminars while more than people have attended the seminars that number includes more than just physicians the health benefits of breakfast may be profoundly overrated that s according to aaron carroll who blames misinterpreted research and biased studies for the widespread belief that breakfast is the most crucial meal of the day for personal health what we re reading a message from national community pharmacists association ncpa while approximately percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients the lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen pharmacy benefit manager pbm corporations are overpaid by medicare and other federal health programs moreover when generic drug prices spike pbm corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates leaving community pharmacies

2015","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edtdrug costs increased percent in the commercial insurance market last year and democrats come out in support of medicare s embattled part b demo but first who s setting policy if donald trump is president who sets the health care agenda in a trump administration if donald trump ultimately becomes president he would need to fill thousands of jobs with civil servants who understand how the massive government bureaucracy functions but many policy experts who have served in past republican administrations and who would appear poised to rejoin the federal government if their party prevails in november don t want anything to do with a trump presidency and that reticence extends to some health care wonks i would never serve in a trump administration said james capretta who oversaw health care programs at the office of management and budget under george w bush the person at the top is unfit for the presidency the uphill climb to attract talent lanhee chen who served as mitt romney s policy director and advised marco rubio this year declined comment when asked about his willingness to serve trump but he did admit the brash businessman faces an uphill climb attracting top tier talent my view is it would be very challenging for a lot of mainstream policy folks to envision working in an administration for somebody who has said some of the things trump has said during the campaign chen said scooplet house dems back white house on drug plan a group of house democrats is defending the obama administration s part b demonstration project in the face of opposition to the project on the part of drug makers doctors republicans and some patient groups we believe this proposal will not only help to fix the current and flawed status quo but will also help combat the increasingly unaffordable prices that drug companies are charging for their products the democrats wrote in a letter to cms that was to be released later today first in pulse patient groups focus complaints on phase of part b demo more than groups led by the partnership to improve patient care are sending a letter to cms acting administrator andy slavitt today with fresh concerns over the agency s planned part b demonstration project while most criticism of the part b demo has centered on medicare s proposed changes to lower its add on payment for drugs the patient groups say that phase of the proposal which would introduce new payment pilots that draw on comparative effectiveness research would hurt patients too for instance the groups take issue with cms s plan to draw on recommendations from icer which the groups contend is led by a governing board that consists mainly of payers with no representation from patients or people with disabilities while no doubt a well intentioned effort to advance value driven health care the approach it takes would represent a major step back for patients and people with disabilities the

expectancy blacks are still at a major health disadvantage compared with whites sabrina tavernese writes in a front page new york times story today but evidence of black gains has been building and has helped push up the ultimate measure life expectancy tavernese rounds up a series of recent federal reports and shows how the gap is closing partly because of improvements in care and partly because life expectancy for whites has fallen in the wake of the opioid crisis and other problems confessions of an ex regulator on how government should work when crafting major reforms like meaningful use regulators really really really want to get it right farzad mostashari said on politico s pulse check podcast last week but they end up being too cautious and conciliatory and that s bad for health care he argues because it protects underperformers and lets them stick around the story for pros what we re reading a message from stop cms cuts medicare has proposed a new payment model for part b drugs that is really an experiment that will take clinical decision making out of the hands of physicians by allowing government bureaucrats to influence decisions for seniors in a cookie cutter approach medicare wants to sway treatment options based solely on cost and not on the patient s individual clinical needs rather than testing payment changes in a limited controlled model this is a mandatory national experiment without patient safeguards and disclosures decisions about a patient s care should be made by physicians in collaboration with patients not government

medicare s part b demo is getting messy topic a on the policy agenda what happens next with part b several house democrats broke from the white house on monday and joined hundreds of republicans in calling for medicare s controversial part b demo to be nixed a move that launched a war of words and competing comment letters what s at stake medicare spent around billion on drugs last year and the demo would test a lower reimbursement rate for high cost drugs administered under part b cms also has proposed piloting value based payment models like reference pricing and outcomes based pricing for certain drugs why monday s news was notable while senate finance committee democrats last week called for changes to the demo monday was the first time that democrats have publicly demanded an end to the project lawmakers also are in the home stretch comments are due to medicare by next monday and a slew of negative letters could affect how fast cms can turn around a final rule and get the project off the ground why four house democrats and house republicans are opposed the representatives maintain that the demo would hurt patient care and affect nearly percent of seniors a deeply troubling scope for a pilot project under cms s medicare drug experiment numerous physicians would face acquisition costs that exceed the medicare payment amount for certain drugs the letter to hhs secretary sylvia mathews burwell and cms acting administrator andy slavitt reads this policy will make it harder for patients to receive the drugs they depend upon it s also worth noting that of the four dissenting house democrats three reps brad ashford collin peterson and kyrsten sinema are top targets for republicans in the election maryland rep dutch ruppersberger is thought to occupy a safe seat why organizations are in favor within minutes of the house letter s release a bevy of groups led by aarp and including afl cio the center for american progress and kaiser permanente fired off a competing comment to burwell and slavitt applauding the initiative as a necessary move toward value driven care we do not believe that the model s proposed changes to medicare part b prescription drug payment will adversely impact beneficiary access to needed care or a provider s ability to make care decisions in the best interest of their patient the groups write we also support cms proposal to test the feasibility of value based pricing strategies that have shown promise in the private insurance market washington post editorial board endorses cms proposal according to the post the medical industry is trying to submarine the proposal in order to protect its profits the executive branch is on the side of consumers and taxpayers this time the post s unsigned editorial reads we hope it

had one of the smallest improvements in cancer related outcomes more for pros from sarah karlin smith insurers increasingly pick up the tab for rising opioid problem while deaths from prescription pain killers quadrupled between and insurers covered a growing share of the tab for the drugs according to one study out of pocket spending fell from for a standard measure of opioids to from and medicare was the largest payer for the drugs covering percent to percent of the cost a second paper found that hospitalizations due to opioid abuse climbed from about in to in with inpatient charges for treatment reaching almost billion in medicaid was the most common payer over that period states that spent more on social services saw healthier residents that s according to a study that found a possible link between addressing social determinants of health and outcomes residents of states that had relatively higher ratios of social to health spending also had improved health across seven measures including adult obesity acute myocardial infarction and type diabetes acute care drug shortages are hanging around the fda user fee law passed in included provisions to stem a surge of shortages in critical drugs they appear to have helped according to this study as the total numbers of active and new drug shortages have come down from peaks in that s not been the case with drugs used in emergency departments and other acute care environments however shortages with those drugs have increased and grown longer compared to non acute medicines some not for profit hospitals continue to report massive profits while only forty five percent of hospitals were profitable in seven of the nation s ten most profitable hospitals were not for profit and all of them reported more

outreach to the uninsured and establish a new refundable tax credit to cover out of pocket health costs repeal the cadillac tax on high cost health plans billion in spending like a growing number of

allow for public option billion in savings clinton plans to increase bargaining power for medicare part d and encourage states to offer a public option in health insurance exchanges crfb applauds clinton s specificity it is quite encouraging that secretary clinton has outlined specific offsets for her new proposals the organization writes by our estimates these savings would cover nearly all the new costs and may more than fully cover the costs once the campaign releases specifics for corporate tax reform it s a striking difference from how crfb described bernie sanders proposals which it

deadline he has already signed off let me know if you have any flags thanks eric v ch friend when people support the democratic party they give a lot of reasons why when you gave xx on date to the dnc it might have been because you alt for nds when folks like you give to the dnc it s often because you want to protect the progress that we ve made over the past seven years or it s because you don t want to see million people lose the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care coverage and because you don t want to see declining graduation rates for our young people and you don t want to see the unprecedented job growth we ve experienced over the past months reversed the xx donations you ve made in this election alt for nds the donations grassroots supporters have made in this election prove just how committed you are to moving this country forward and we can t thank you enough for that every single day folks like you are laying the foundation for some critical wins in november in important races all across the country not just the presidential race we re poised to replace governors and senators who are living in the past with democrats whose vision for the future of this country means actually moving this country into the future so right now i m coming to you again because we need you name we need you to dig deep and pitch in again before our monthly deadline saturday at midnight can i count on you to pitch in or whatever you can to make sure our candidates have the resources they need to win linksthanks name we can t win without you bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v ejb democrats have been pretty fortunate this election cycle name we have two terrific presidential candidates in hillary clinton and bernie sanders making us proud with smart substantive debates and focusing on the issues that really matter it s a world of difference from the pettiness and name calling we ve seen on the other side and because republican senators so often refuse to do their jobs we ve got a map that s in our favor and a good chance to take back our majority this is all good news but unfortunately republican in fighting hasn t distracted them from their desire to beat us and i know that because it s my job to look at the numbers and so far the gop has raised more than million to beat us that s a lot of money name and i ll be honest it s more than we ve raised but here s a bit more good news there s still time to build the kind of foundation we need to win in november we just need grassroots supporters like you to step up and help us cross that finish line can i count on you to pitch in or more before this next end of month deadline linksthanks so much with the help of supporters like you i know we re going to knock this one out of the park bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v jgr friend i m going to be very straightforward with you name we haven t raised as much money as our counterparts on the republican side we re coming up short according to their most recent fec reports the rnc has raised million during this election that s a hell of a lot of money and while we might not catch up to their mega donors we have another resource that matters even more you with grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like or bucks we re slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure that democrats all across the country are going to benefit from come november we re laying the foundation for serious wins and we need to keep going every time someone like you decides to click that donate button and give whatever you can it s another voice telling the rnc and the millionaires and billionaires who are backing them that they can t buy this election we ve got the right candidates and we re fighting on the right side of history now we ve just got to see it through til november th so name i m asking you to be one of those voices right now push this button and pitch in or whatever you can to support democrats up and down the ticket all across the country donate buttonthanks a lot bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v er friend last week the republican national committee released their fec fundraising report from march and i won t mince words we got beat and the republicans have now raised more than million in total all to beat us in november that means this month s deadline just got that much more important we need to start making up the difference now if we re going to give our presidential

president barack obama announced on monday the biggest expansion of u s ground troops in syria since its civil war began but the move was unlikely to mollify arab allies angry over washington s cautious approach to the conflict the deployment of up to special forces soldiers increases u s forces in syria roughly six fold and is aimed at helping militia fighters who have clawed back territory from islamic state in a string of victories defense experts said giving more fighters on the ground access to u s close air support could shift the momentum in syria but a senior member of the saudi royal family who asked not to be identified dismissed the decision as window dressing obama says new troops underscore priority of isil fight via our colleague nick gass the white house s decision to send an additional special forces to syria to aid in the fight against the islamic state underscores his administration s priority to dismantle the terrorist group president barack obama said it represents what i ve said from the start which is that us dismantling isil is a priority and although we are not going to send ground troops in to fight we are going to try to find out what works and

military s six year old cyber command for the first time to mount computer network attacks that are now being used alongside more traditional weapons the effort reflects president obama s desire to bring many of the secret american cyberweapons that had been aimed elsewhere notably at iran into the fight against the islamic state which has proved effective in using modern communications and encryption to recruit and carry out operations the national security agency which specializes in electronic surveillance has for years listened intensely to the militants of the islamic state and

enduring mysteries of president obama s tenure what really happened to the bust of winston churchill that was once displayed in the oval office with just months left in his term mr obama s first comments on the matter in europe last week may have finally cleared up the truth of a tale that has persisted for more than seven years for conservatives in both america and britain the disappearance of the bust from its place of honor soon after the end of george w bush s presidency was evidence of a liberal snub by mr obama in their view he clearly did not fully appreciate the greatness of the

because we could speculate for the next several hours on what these pages say absent some possible compromise of u s sources and methods of intelligence gathering i d just make all pages public let s see what s in there and then we can talk about it bolton said i think its important to note that the saudi government itself has said for or years now that they agree to make the pages public so i don

combat cyberbullying dawson said she and other sanders supporters were being bullied by clinton s allies we are literally under attack for not just supporting the other candidate dawson said in remarks introducing sanders to the crowd now i m with monica lewinsky with this bullying is bad she has actually dedicated her life now to talking about that and now as a campaign strategy we are being bullied and somehow that is okay and not being talked about with the richness that it needs washington post john wagnerbernie sanders s path to the democratic presidential nomination may have narrowed considerably since his loss to hillary clinton in the new york primary but he showed sunday that he can still turn out big time crowds more than people gathered in a downtown park here for a sanders rally on sunday night according to park officials just hours after more than people streamed to an outdoor event in providence r i connecticut and rhode island are among the five states that will hold primaries tuesday when clinton is hoping to further tighten her grip on the party s nomination the senator from vermont took markedly different approaches regarding clinton at his two rallies in providence he barely mentioned her name during his hour long stump speech a signal some thought that he might be dialing back his criticism as his odds of prevailing grow longer politico nick gassthe united states needs to get to the root cause of the attacks bernie sanders said in an interview aired sunday explaining his support for senate legislation that would allow the families of terror victims the right to sue foreign governments and entities in federal court including saudi arabia i think there s a lot about saudi arabia that we don t fully understand and i want to get to the root cause of it sanders told chuck todd on nbc news meet the press the root of what saudi arabia has done remarking that there is some evidence and we will have to ascertain whether it s accurate or not that money from saudi arabia actually funded a attack sanders noted that saudi money is going all over the world to fund the austere wahhabi form of islam and i think that the full extent of the role that saudi arabia plays in supporting extremism in this world is something that we should explore sanders said politico nick gassbernie sanders on sunday announced that he had earned the backing of the united electrical radio and machine workers of america in the democratic candidate s latest endorsement from a major national labor union as he looks to gain momentum ahead of tuesday s five primaries peter knowlton the union s national president called the vermont senator in a statement released through his campaign the most pro worker pro union presidential candidate i have seen in my lifetime adding that sanders candidacy is a unique opportunity that workers and unions must not pass up rank and file local delegates from the member organization unanimously approved the

nick gasson saturday bernie sanders supporter rosario dawson said she stood with monica lewinsky in the fight against bullying on sunday morning bernie sanders shrugged off the invocation of lewinsky the former white house intern with whom the husband of his democratic rival infamously had an affair as president we are literally under attack not just for supporting the other candidate the actress told a crowd in wilmington delaware as she introduced the senator adding i m with monica lewinsky on this bullying is bad dawson also called it a clinton campaign strategy asked on cnn s state of the union whether that was appropriate sanders instead talked up the great job the great actress is doing for the campaign and she has been a passionate fighter to see the voter turnout that we fight for racial economic environmental justice what our job right now is to contrast our views compared to secretary clinton that s what a campaign is about sanders said reiterating that he would approach the campaign in an issue oriented way not by personal attacks but by contrasting our view to hillary clinton the hill kyle balluckdemocratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders in an interview broadcast sunday rejected a proposed soda tax to pay for pre kindergarten programs in philadelphia an initiative backed by rival hillary clinton it is a totally regressive tax and right now at a time of massive income and wealth inequality when the wealthy are getting wealthier many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people sanders said on nbc s meet the press you have large multinational corporations not paying a nickel in federal taxes that s where you get the money somebody s making a year and they buy a bottle of soda i don t think you charge them more for that bottle of soda sanders said he absolutely agrees with the goal of universal childcare the hill jessie hellmanndemocratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders on sunday did not directly answer a question about whether it was appropriate for actress rosario dawson a sanders surrogate to mention former white house intern monica lewinsky at a rally saturday rosario is a great actress and she s doing a great job for us sanders said sunday on cnn s state of the union i have no idea in what context rosario is talking about but i would hope that all of our people talk about the real issue sanders also said people should be talking about climate change instead of his surrogate and by the way it might be a good idea for all of us including tv networks to start talking about the planetary crisis of climate change sanders added dawson on saturday took a swipe at sanders s rival hillary clinton by mentioning lewinsky who has become an anti bullying activist following her alleged affair with former president bill clinton and accusing the front runner s campaign of bullying the hill rebecca savranskydemocratic presidential candidate bernie sanders said on sunday that if rival hillary clinton secures the nomination he ll have to look at her platform before he commits to making an enthusiastic case for her that is totally dependent on what the clinton platform is and how she responds to the needs of millions of americans who are sick and tired of establishment politics and establishment economics sanders said on abc s this week in response to a question about whether he d back her in the same way she pushed for president obama in you know i can t snap my finger and tell people what to do sanders said he hopes that if clinton is the nominee she will put together the strongest progressive agenda he noted he will also do everything he can to make sure republican front runner donald trump or some other right wing republican does not become president we do not need more tax breaks for billionaires more cuts to social security medicare more ignoring the facts he said fox bernie sanders says he is trailing hillary clinton in the democratic presidential primary because poor people don t vote when asked why he consistently lost contests in states with the highest income inequality gaps the populist vermont senator said on meet the press sunday that he wouldn t trail front runner clinton by pledged delegates and total delegates if more low income voters showed up to the ballot box i mean that s just a fact sanders said that s a sad reality of american society and that s what we have to transform we have one as you know one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth we have done a good job bringing young people in i think we have done had some success with lower income people but in america today the last election in percent of poor people did not vote sanders has cited that statistic before as his insurgent candidacy has taken hold with disaffected democrats who want someone with an ideology to clinton s left a politifact examination found the number to be an overestimation by anywhere from to points the hill rebecca savranskydemocratic

re proud of the campaign we ran he said on nbc s meet the press in an interview sunday sanders said his campaign still has a narrow path to victory and he said he plans to continue fighting and hopes to win the vermont senator also touted the progress his campaign has made noting it brought millions of young people out who i think many of the pundits had thought were kind of apathetic not interested in politics we re going to have to do obviously win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain a poll came out yesterday that has us within striking distance in california a larger state he said i think we can do very well in california nbc sally bronstonare we getting the first preview of what a bernie sanders exit interview could look like the vermont senator seemed to have a more resigned tone on sunday during an interview on nbc s meet the press sanders conceded his campaign has only a narrow path to victory but that they would fight through that path we hope to win this was a different tone than the one he used just a few weeks ago when he confidently assured supporters we are going to win new york he ended up losing the state to hillary clinton by points yet sanders insisted his campaign is not writing our obituary looking ahead sanders said we re in this race to california and we re proud of the campaign we ran boston globe james a kimbleus senator bernie sanders barely mentioned hillary clinton during a rally that drew more than people to the grassy fields of roger williams park just two days before the state s primary what supporters and curious voters did hear was sanders assertion that a political revolution for the working class could only happen if voters of the ocean state mobilized to the polls what we have found throughout this campaign is when voter turnout is high when working people and young people when the middle class people come out in big numbers we often win sanders told a cheering crowd before a backdrop of a lake and the stand of roman columns that make up the temple to music pavilion when voter turnout is low we don t do well i would hope on tuesday that rhode island has the largest turnout for a democratic primary in the history of the state politico nick gassthere is almost the question as to why cigarettes are legal in the united states bernie sanders said in an interview aired sunday on nbc s meet the press the remark came as sanders explained his opposition to a proposed tax on sugary drinks in philadelphia which would fund pre kindergarten education reiterating that it is a totally regressive tax that results in poorer people paying even more in taxes if they buy a bottle of soda when moderator chuck todd asked him if he felt the same way about cigarette taxes sanders said he did not cigarette taxes are there s a difference between cigarettes and soda the vermont senator said i am aware of the obesity problem in this country todd replied i don t think michael bloomberg would agree with you on that one referring to the former new york mayor s infamous effort to limit the size of sugary drinks sold in the city the state s highest court in ruled that the city had overstepped its regulatory bounds by implementing the rule new york times nicholas confessoreeven as his chances of winning the democratic presidential nomination slip away senator bernie sanders and his allies are trying to use his popularity to expand his political influence setting up an ideological struggle for the soul of the democratic party in the post obama era aides to mr sanders have been pressing party officials for a significant role in drafting the platform for the democratic convention in july aiming to lock in strong planks on issues like a an hour federal minimum wage breaking up wall street banks and banning natural gas fracking amid his unexpectedly strong showing in the democratic primaries mr sanders has tapped his two million person donor list to raise money for liberal congressional candidates in new york nevada and washington state and in the waning months of barack obama s presidency mr sanders s allies are testing their muscle against the white house mounting a public attack on the president s housing secretary juliã n castro over his department s sales of delinquent mortgages to banks and private equity firms republicansthe hill jonathan swanrepublican mega donors increasingly fed up with their party s circus like presidential primary are sitting on their checkbooks until the nominee is decided gop campaigns and super pacs saw dismal fundraising figures in march john kasich s campaign took in million and his super pac million for the month numbers bernie sanders s campaign can beat on a good day and ted cruz isn t doing much better after a strong start his super pac s income has slowed to a trickle and his campaign took in just million in march less than half of hillary clinton s campaign haul and about a quarter of sanders s total interviews with major republican donors and fundraisers reveal that many are fed up after early enthusiasm for unsuccessful candidates many of these donors spent millions on the super pacs supporting jeb bush and marco rubio one time favorites who dropped out of the race after getting throttled by donald trump politico nick gassnew york times michael barbarocharles g koch the billionaire industrialist suggested in an interview sunday that he was open to supporting hillary clinton for president and said it was possible she would make a better president than her republican rivals it was an unexpected sentiment from mr koch who has for years deployed his vast wealth to champion conservative causes and republican candidacies emerging as a major foe of the democratic party mr koch sounded at times baffled and disappointed by the language and ideas of several republican presidential candidates in an interview with jonathan karl of abc which aired on this week with george stephanopoulos he called a plan by donald j trump to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country monstrous and dismissed senator ted cruz s proposal to carpet bomb territory held by the islamic state as frightening hyperbole washington post vanessa williamsconservative political activist charles koch suggested in an interview with abc news on sunday that democrat hillary clinton would be a better president than the republican contenders although he stopped short of saying he would support the former secretary of state if she ends up representing her party in a general election the billionaire who with brother david has been active in republican party politics criticized the tone of the gop presidential primary campaign citing it as the reason the brothers have not contributed to any campaigns including efforts to derail republican front runner donald trump in the interview with chief white house correspondent jonathan karl which aired on abc s this week with george stephanopoulos charles koch said bill clinton had done a better job than george w bush in controlling government growth while president the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican national committee chairman reince priebus said in an interview sunday the chances of his party heading toward a contested convention in july are no longer increasing i think they ve plateaued he said on abc s this week in response to a question on whether the chances of a contested convention were falling on the delegate front obviously trump s got a little bit of a lead but if you look on the delegate selection front it looks like a pretty split decision so i think it s going to be a close contest going into the next days he said priebus said the republican party will eventually unify behind its nominee he said he expects the party to have a strong case to make to the american people we re working hard to make sure that we ve got an open and fair convention so that we get to that place where we can unify around one person he said the hill niall stanagedonald trump is set to shift his strategy to win the white house becoming less antagonistic toward the gop establishment and adopting a less abrasive tone on social issues but the approach brings risks as well as potential rewards at a closed door briefing with republican national committee rnc members thursday trump aide paul manafort assured his audience that his boss is not running against the national party and that he cares about the united team in his remarks first reported by the new york times manafort also raised eyebrows by saying of trump the part he s been playing is evolving but trump will have to tread a fine line as comments he made at the weekend acknowledged at a saturday rally in waterbury conn trump suggested that he would never have reached his current position as the dominant gop front runner had he acted presidential from the outset of his campaign the key question is whether trump can establish more civil relations with the rnc and set a more sober minded tone in general while also not disenchanting supporters who were drawn to the businessman as a brash voice unwilling to pay deference to the powers that be the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican presidential front runner donald trump said sunday during a campaign rally he thinks he will sweep all five states in the upcoming contests tuesday trump has millions of votes more by that time because you look tuesday it looks like five i don t know but i believe in polls he said during the rally in hagerstown md when talking about the convention in july so let s say we win five we win all five states we pick up a lot he said he expects to get to the required delegates needed to secure the nomination ahead of the republican convention and will add to his delegate count on tuesday he is winning by millions and millions of votes he said while also calling the system unfair in the five states that vote on tuesday connecticut delaware maryland pennsylvania and rhode island trump has a double digit lead according to the realclearpolitics average of polls in maryland he has a point lead over rival john kasich trump had percent support followed by kasich with percent and ted cruz with percent the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican presidential front runner donald trump said sunday he expects to secure the republican nomination on the first ballot i m only interested in the first ballot he said during a rally in hagerstown md i m not interested in second third fourth nineteenth because i m really interested in winning it early and that s it trump said he s not playing games adding he s going to win in states that other republicans are not even going to campaign in but during the rally trump slammed the primary system calling it unfair he criticized rival ted cruz for bribing delegates he s bribing people essentially to vote he said now he can t do it on the first ballot because they re locked into me on the first ballot he said that s all i care about i only care about the first trump said he s pretty sure he s going to get the delegates required to secure the nomination i m millions of votes up on cruz millions of votes up on kasich he said i think we re going to make it easily he added later the hill jessie hellmannrepublican presidential front runner donald trump holds a double digit lead in pennsylvania ahead of the state s april primary according to a new poll released sunday trump leads rival texas sen ted cruz percent to percent followed by ohio gov john kasich at percent according to the nbc news wall street journal marist poll the poll shows that trump performs poorly among college graduates only getting percent support from that crowd and women with only percent of republican women saying they support the businessman alternatively percent of gop voters without a college degree support trump and the same percentage of men back the candidate pennsylvania is one of five eastern states voting tuesday and offers delegates the hill jessie hellmanndonald trump jr said during an interview sunday that his father s campaign would do what we need to do to win the gop nomination when asked about wooing delegates i think we re going to do what we need to do to a point but i think we want to win without having to do that trump jr said on cnn s state of the union trump jr has accused presidential rival ted cruz of bribing delegates and taking away the voice of the voters while his father gop presidential front runner donald trump has said he refuses to do the same as he fights to clinch the republican party s nomination that s been cruz s game from day one because he s not an appealing candidate to the general election voters trump jr said the hill rebecca savranskydonald trump s convention manager paul manafort on sunday said his comments that the republican front runner is playing a part and will start to pivot toward a more presidential persona were taken out of context i was talking about rallies versus some other setting he said on fox news sunday in the context of that room that s what was said and that s what was understood manafort told members of the republican national committee rnc at the party s spring meeting in hollywood fla that trump gets it the part that he s been playing is now evolving into the part that you ve been expecting the negatives will come down the image is going to change but crooked hillary is still going to be crooked hillary manafort added referring to trump s moniker for democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton on the campaign setting you re seeing the real donald trump in campaign mode talking to people who believe in his candidacy he said on fox news sunday washington post vanessa williamsdonald trump s new campaign manager said sunday that his comments that the republican front runner was evolving from a rough and sometimes raucous candidate to one with a more presidential persona in preparation for the general election had been taken out of context paul manafort whose leaked comments at a private meeting last week with republican party leaders have prompted questions anew about trump s loyalty to the party and its conservative ideology said on fox news sunday that he was not referring to the candidate s core beliefs we were talking about evolving the campaign not the candidate manafort said he sought to convince a skeptical chris wallace that he was referring to how trump talks to cheering followers at campaign events versus when he s giving speeches on policy settings that are not rally oriented new york times alan rappeporthis style has evoked polarizing political figures like barry goldwater george wallace and edward i koch but as the presidential campaign moves through pennsylvania donald j trump is reviving memories of someone who stirred local passions like few others frank l rizzo of philadelphia a former police officer who was nicknamed big bambino mr rizzo rose to power during the city s crime ridden s and s cracking down on lawlessness with a legendary bellicosity after becoming police commissioner he rounded up homosexuals late at night forced the black panthers to strip down in the streets and once appeared with a nightstick stuffed in the cummerbund of his tuxedo as mayor he threatened to break the heads of criminals and boasted that his police department was strong enough to invade cuba the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican presidential front runner donald trump said if he loses the republican nomination people shouldn t expect him to stick around in the public eye they fight like hell for six months and they re saying horrible things the worst things you can imagine trump said during a rally in maryland on sunday and then one of them loses one of them wins and the one who loses says i just want to congratulate my opponent he is a brilliant man he ll be a great governor or president or whatever he said i m not sure you re ever going to see me there i don t think i m going to lose but if i do i don t think you re ever going to see me again folks i think i ll go to turnberry and play golf or something trump said sometimes the winner will put losing candidates in the administration washington post chris cillizzaif donald trump were a car he would be a porsche if he were an animal he d be a lion and people like porsches and lions or at least walmart moms do according to a focus group of republican primary voting walmart moms conducted this past week in pittsburgh by democratic pollster margie omero and republican pollster neil newhouse walmart moms are defined as women who have children younger than at home and have gone to the store at least once in the past month the focus groups the two pollsters did another one with swing moms in suburban philadelphia were funded by walmart characterizing donald trump as a type of car or animal resulted in some fascinating descriptions from the gop group women depicted him as a porsche a ferrari a muscle car a boxer who stands his ground a bulldog an escalade a lion fierce and king of the jungle and as an unpredictable cat newhouse and omero wrote in a memo summarizing the results these moms praised him as someone who speaks his mind stands his ground and is refreshingly politically incorrect politico politico staffconservative billionaire charles koch chastised donald trump for his plan to register all muslims calling the idea monstrous that s reminiscent of nazi germany i mean that s monstrous as i said at the time koch said in an interview with abc news jonathan karl koch also said trump s proposal to temporarily ban all muslims from entering the united states is antithetical to our approach trump has previously said if elected president he d support creating a database of all muslims in america he later backed off the comment saying a reporter had suggested the database koch also said during the interview that it s possible that another clinton would be better than a republican president the hill rebecca savranskybillionaire businessman and campaign funding powerhouse charles koch said in an interview broadcast sunday that he s been asked to contribute to the never trump movement but has decided to focus instead on how to improve the country that s not what we do he said on abc s this week when asked why he hasn t become involved in the never trump movement what we re trying to do is build alliances to make the country better like we have one with the white house on criminal justice reform you do it by trying to find areas where you can work with everybody koch did criticize republican front runner donald trump s proposal to put a temporary ban on letting any muslims enter the country however obviously that s antithetical to our approach but what was worse was this we ll have them all register he said that s reminiscent of nazi germany i mean that s monstrous as i said at the time koch also dodged a question about whether he is going to sit out this presidential election saying he has to look into the nominee once a candidate is chosen politico nick gassdonald trump is going through a natural evolution as a presidential candidate his son donald trump jr said sunday there s aspects of things where he ll take things to a level that they need to be taken to to be able to draw attention to it trump jr told cnn s state of the union noting that on any of the issues his father has addressed he ll talk about them in a way no one else has he ll take them to a certain level issues that were taboo that no one wanted to touch trump jr said people are actually talking about it trump jr rejected the notion that his father s campaign to this point has been an act but rather that sometimes he has to talk about things in a certain way to draw the requisite attention that that topic actually needs no one else will touch it if he hasn t done that he continued so i think for him this is a natural evolution switching over getting focused on the general election where he s going to have to talk to the broader audience so i think it s a very natural progression politico kristen eastdonald trump and hillary clinton hold comfortable leads among rhode island voters according to a new brown university poll clinton leads bernie sanders percent to percent trump leads his rivals by double digits with percent of likely voters john kasich and ted cruz follow at percent and percent roughly the same number of democrats and republicans are undecided percent of democrats and percent of republicans all likely voters are unsure of which candidate to support on tuesday the poll surveyed likely voters in rhode island democrats and republicans the margin of error for the democratic results is plus or minus percentage points and percentage points for republican results washington post fenit nirappilcan donald trump become best friends with the man he dismisses as lyin ted cruz the republican presidential front runner suggested it could happen after a bruising primary at a sunday rally in a packed airport hangar in hagerstown md with a person capacity maryland is one of five states along the northeast corridor that will vote tuesday an opportunity for trump to widen his delegate lead over cruz a senator from texas after tearing into cruz as the worst liar he has encountered and accusing him of trying to bribe delegates trump offered praise for his fallen rivals in the once person gop field wisconsin gov scott walker whom trump last month declared is not doing a great job became a great governor he dubbed sen marco rubio fla a great guy instead of little marco and he called sen lindsey o graham s c whose cellphone number he once gave out at a rally a nice guy politico nick gassted cruz s only path to the republican nomination is by bribing the delegates donald trump jr said in an interview with cnn s state of the union aired sunday going on to suggest that has always been the texas senator s plan because is not appealing to the general electorate you know ted cruz has no chance of winning this without bribing the delegates trump s eldest son remarked noting that cruz has been mathematically eliminated blasting cruz s delegate strategy trump jr commented that the senator will try to get there he ll do this and subsequently lose more states than mitt romney because i can t name a single state that mitt lost that ted can possibly win so i think at this point the republican establishment would much rather just hand the things over to hillary hand the reins over to her let her run it because guess what trump jr said going on to say that he certainly question s the motives of the party the hill rebecca savranskya senior official in the reagan administration wrote an op ed published sunday urging pennsylvania residents to support republican presidential candidate ted cruz since my days working for sen henry scoop jackson d wash events in the middle east and especially concerning the security of israel have been at the center of my attention elliott abrams wrote in the philadelphia inquirer piece titled cruz understands dangers realities of mideast and if israel s security and its relationship with the united states are a key concern ted cruz should get your vote more broadly if your concern is america s position in the middle east your vote should go to cruz abrams said cruz is intelligent and has a good grasp on the dangers in both the middle east and israel he also wrote that the texas senator had a commitment to israel s security while gop front runner donald trump is talking about extracting more from israel for its defense cruz wants to beef up the missile defense programs like iron dome david s sling and arrow that are crucial for israel and immensely valuable for the united states with our bases all over the globe he wrote washington post ed o keefeted cruz dominated the race for delegate seats at weekend republican meetings nationwide further positioning the senator from texas to overtake donald trump in the race for the gop presidential nomination if the contest is decided on later ballots at the republican national convention in some instances cruz supporters won delegate seats in states that trump won meaning that in most cases they will be required to vote for the businessman on a first ballot but if trump fails to win the nomination in the first round those cruz supporters could switch to the senator on subsequent ballots the trump campaign has assured supporters that it would begin performing better in such settings but it still seems more focused on winning most of the remaining contests through june and securing the delegates needed before the cleveland convention the hill jessie hellmanngop presidential hopeful john kasich on sunday dismissed claims from the donald trump campaign that the front runner will adopt a less abrasive tone as the republican national convention in july approaches you can t turn negatives around overnight it s not possible to do because when you create that that negative impression in people you just can t talk your way out of it unfortunately for those that have high negatives trump aide paul manafort told members of the republican national committee last thursday that the billionaire businessman is evolving that part that he s been playing is now evolving into the part that you ve been expecting the negatives will come down the image is going to change manafort said politico kristen eastoklahoma sen jim inhofe is supporting john kasich not so that he could be president instead hoping he would be the vice presidential pick should donald trump wrap up the republican nomination and boost the party s chances of winning in november i support john kasich not so that he could be president but so that if donald trump becomes president i would want trump to use him as vice president because kasich is one of the smartest guys i know inhofe said according to the enid news in oklahoma inhofe previously supported florida sen marco rubio before he dropped out in march he then came out in support of kasich speaking to locals at the enid woodring regional airport this weekend inhofe said he believes trump can only be elected if he wins in ohio and having kasich as his running mate would be a boon to his chances there the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican presidential candidate john kasich said sunday his campaign is looking at potential running mates for if he secures the nomination well we have some old hands now who are beginning to do that he said on cbs s face the nation you know these things come quickly and you don t want to have yourself in a position where you have to pick somebody out of a hat so i have some skilled hands who are beginning now to take a look and figure out who would really fit and you know it s just starting so there isn t a lot to report he said it s possible he ll announce his vice presidential pick by june before the republican national convention in july kasich said he approved of the campaign vetting potential candidates but said its strategy is something you talk about as a group but we re at the preliminary stage and yeah i think it s always possible he said editorials op edsnew york times editorial boardwashington post editorial boardthe racists who rewrote virginia s constitution

"2016-04-27 01:41","Five takeaways from Tuesdayâ€™s primaries","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," five takeaways from tuesday s primariesby glenn thrush pm edtdonald trump finally broke through the crass ceiling trump s campaign is in turmoil oh and he s groping for a grown up message trump trails in every single head to head matchup against every single democrat trump won t read a briefing paper won t pass up an opportunity to heckle a chump won t use decent grammar a competent hairdresser or a polysyllabic speechwriter yet the tangerine tornado keeps winning and winning by huger and huger margins shattering the never trump army and making mockery of the shotgun marriage between chastened foes ted cruz and john kasich whether he ll hit the delegates needed to secure the nomination before cleveland nobody knows but the developer reality star frontrunner did something in five big races tuesday night that he s never done before he consolidated the gop base behind him with a succession of slam dunk wins that will make it hard for his opponents to argue he s not the party s legit choice in most of his previous wins he struggled to break percent on tuesday he won with percent of the vote in pennsylvania a semi battleground in november that he ll need to win if he s to avoid the loserland fates of goldwater mondale and mcgovern oh and hillary clinton did pretty well too here are five takeaways bernie s choice sanders is not going to be the democratic nominee a little secret despite the hype and sanders small state seven of eight winning streak the result was mostly baked in after clinton s five state sweep on march and the door more or less slammed shut after his point defeat in new york but after losing another three big northeastern non south states pennsylvania and maryland sanders seems to be trapped in a classic delegate death spiral he trails clinton by more than pledged delegates and hundreds more when you throw in super delegates but he s not going gently tuesday night in west virginia swigging water to soothe his shredded throat from a huge bernie bottle the vermont senator raged against the gathering gloom making a direct pitch to supers party regulars who are highly unlikely to buy his argument that he s better positioned to beat trump in november this is superficially true but sanders hasn t absorbed a fraction of the attacks clinton has and it s not clear he would be doing as well had he been in the crosshairs but this email from a sanders supporter and former clinton democratic senate opponent jonathan tasini speaks of the precarious state of his candidacy despite the in rushing millions in online cash and adoring crowds of college kids i think it s clear that at least tonight bernie intends on forging ahead all the way to the convention no matter the results tonight wrote tasini the sanders campaign seems to be deeply divided on the subject of how best to proceed early tuesday sanders top strategist tad devine head of the peace party in camp bernie hinted of a wednesday reassessment that was followed by a fundraising email from campaign manager jeff weaver he of the fixed brow and warlike scowl featuring a photo of the clintons yucking it up with trump none of this matters his play now is for leverage on the issues he cares most about campaign finance reform and income inequality and he needs to decide whether he ll go rogue as the sarandon robbins wing of his base wants or do what he s always done in the senate accept his fate as an influential but not dominant force in the democratic party swallow hard and join the fold hoosier or loser nobody s run a more clever message disciplined tightly organized campaign than the tea party prig turned darling of the gop establishment ted cruz but cruz with that squinty eyed sepulchral smile is just not likeable enough for voters cruz seemed poised to break out of his southern evangelical box with his big win in wisconsin but tuesday s crushing losses means his win there was a blip not a race reset and speaks to his lack of broad appeal cruz has one more shot a decisive win in the suddenly seminal indiana primary on may the state seems to be a much better fit than the northeast where cruz s cornbread conservatism played poorly john kasich governor of neighboring ohio is going nowhere even faster than cruz and conceded the inevitable a couple of days ago issuing himself a get out of indiana free card given the current dynamics of the primary there we will shift our campaign s resources west and give the cruz campaign a clear path in indiana he wrote in a press release oh if only it were that easy a few hours before his rollicking victories on tuesday night trump announced he d been endorsed by chair throwing hoosier hoops legend bobby knight who has been politically incorrect even longer than the donald a pax on both their houses during a triumphant victory speech in philly where the candidate seemed to be uncommonly relaxed clinton offered sanders an olive branch bristling with small rhetorical thorns an entreaty to begin peace talks but only on victor s terms for all his determination to gut it out through the convention sanders has sprinkled a discreet bread crumb trail of reconciliation suggesting this week that clinton could reunite the party but only if she heeded the anti establishment clamor from his increasingly embittered millions we will unify our party to win this election she intoned to shouts of agreement a couple of weeks after telling me that she doubted whether her opponent was even a real democrat then a more direct appeal to bernie and his bros i applaud senator sanders for challenging us to get unaccountable money out our politics she added a few days after sanders team had for the millionth time demanded she release the text of her goldman sachs speeches how they come together or don t will likely be the most important democratic storyline of in clinton faced with a considerably more sanguine scenario at this point in her campaign she trailed barack obama by far fewer delegates and had yet to see her grip on party insider super delegates slip away soldiered on through the california primary publicly her people say they expect sanders to do the same and respect him for his pluck in private they want no such thing and desperately hope to find an elegant way to make the man go away or at least tone down his attacks so she can spend the next few months repairing her tattered approval ratings and building bridges with progressives trump is still in deep deep trouble not since ozymandias has a colossus stood on such crumbly legs for all his big primary wins tuesday night the easy money right now anyway is that he d lose every single one of them in a general election rhode island delaware maryland connecticut and even pennsylvania by massive perhaps unprecedented margins two thirds of american voters disapprove of trump and a significant percentage of those people have said they will never ever not if he was the last man on earth vote for him his hands may be big enough but they grab too many five irons and too few white papers for many college educated voters to buy him as a serious presidential possibility and there aren t enough angry white working class voters to make up for the tsunami of opposition from minorities and women he s likely to face he s giving a big foreign policy speech in dc on wednesday presumably employing the teleprompter that he s long mocked obama for using presumably brimming with actual names facts and figures he s eschewed in the past but if reports out of his camp are to be believed he refuses to be domesticated and happily blew through the advice of new adviser paul manafort to behave more like a conventional leader during the acela primaries that was either a huge campaign killing mistake or merely a veteran pitchman s awareness that you can t change your brand halfway through a marketing campaign without destroying the product either way he s screwed lady s night it s a symptom of trump s centrality that clinton following her successes on tuesday stood on the precipice of history and hardly anyone noticed except her she has more or less secured her position as the first female nominee of a major party and in that s not merely a glass ceiling shattering feel good moment but a hammer to use against a republican frontrunner who systematically alienated women responding to trump s recent claim that she was playing the woman card a smiling clinton told her victory night audience deal me in that won t be the last time you hear that line to view online "

nomination is a reminder that for years the republican party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain and just like republicans in washington have done for years dangerous donald is only looking out for himself his plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country back to where we were when the last republican president left office losing jobs a month the american people can t afford to let him bully his way into the oval office dangerous donald trump has already damaged america s relationships across the

with embarrassing failures that make it clear the american people can t afford to let him get anywhere near the white house national security even as a candidate dangerous donald has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would undeniably make america less safe donald trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well respected experts trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words on his good brain trump has falsely claimed that he knows more about isis than the generals and recommended that the u s military commit international war crimes trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on european territory and wants to allow countries that don t currently have nuclear weapons to get them reversing long

their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career trump once said you had to treat women like s t and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names fat pig slob or bimbo and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be griping and bitching trump would take away a woman s right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished but not the doctors that performed them and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to the marketplace and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was an inconvenience for a business trump complained that when he employed mothers they were not giving him percent divisive and dangerous donald trump exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the pursuit of getting elected to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about muslims and called to surveil mosques to ban muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all muslims in america including u s citizens and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from nazi germany trump called mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and said they brought disease into the country said you needed to check if native americans were real indians and claimed that a well educated black has a tremendous advantage but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in trump properties because in the s the trump organization was sued for discriminating against blacks and puerto ricans trump has been endorsed by former kkk leader david duke and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement which is no surprise since trump refused to disavow david duke and the kkk four times in one interview trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies suggesting that a black lives matter protester maybe should have been roughed up promising to pay the legal fees if someone would knock the hell out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be carried off on a stretcher trump repeatedly threatened the first amendment by calling to open up libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies and thought closing parts of the internet was a rational strategy to combat isis bad at business bad for the economy though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman dangerous donald s real life record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday americans despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of american jobs donald trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against like china and mexico dangerous donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family dangerous donald s businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt leaving investors contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions during one of his business bankruptcies his personal finances were at the mercy of banks who put him on an allowance of per month his trump university fleeced thousands of americans simply looking to get ahead trump s tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while costing the country trillion to implement more than any other republican plan proposed it also violates his pledge not to increase the national debt trump actually said at one of the republican party s debates that wages are too high and opposed raising the minimum wage trump wants to repeal the affordable care act which would jeopardize health care for million americans who ve been able to get coverage under obamacare republicans couldn t unite against him and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they

Thune on TSA: #ThanksObama","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from lauren gardner jennifer scholtes kathryn a wolfe and heather cayglein the express lane senate majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to wrap up the transportation housing and urban development appropriations bill by the end of this week in alignment with the get er done strategy he outlined last week as part of his mission to get back to back bills pushed through the senate floor in quick succession to that end cloture was filed on tuesday evening to the substitute and the underlying bill latest developments sen richard blumenthal d conn submitted an amendment tuesday night that would combat changes to the controversial trucking hours of service rule instead returning the regulations to the obama administration s previous hour weekly driving limit the senate also passed a series of amendments by voice vote including one by sen joe manchin d w v aimed at enabling airport runway repair projects and another by sen cory booker d n j that addresses eligibility for federally funded construction projects related to passenger rail at the same time house republican appropriators unveiled their billion draft fiscal spending bill for transportation and housing that offers percent more federal dollars than the senate counterpart dot would get a million boost over current levels check out lauren s story to parse out some of the numbers in short faa fra and amtrak get roughly the same lump sum as what they received under the senate version subcommittee chairman mario diaz balart r fla this bill provides for our nation s transportation and housing needs while making tough choices to protect hard earned taxpayer dollars ranking democrat david price of north carolina it s enough of an allocation to let us work on it cooperatively and that s exactly what we ve done keep on trucking two issues may become legislative sticking points and they both have to do with trucking one is the reappearance of the controversial provision on superseding state laws for meal and rest breaks for commercial truckers that nearly tanked the fast act and also reared its head during the house faa bill process same problem different solution the other point of tension results from efforts to fix a drafting error in the fiscal omnibus on trucker rest breaks the senate came up with their own controversial add on and the house is tackling the problem too but it s got a different fix the house change ensures the hour restart rule in effect before the obama administration proposed new hours of service rules in would apply to commercial truckers lauren writes and it would prohibit regulators from enforcing two requirements the administration finalized in house t amp i ranking democrat peter defazio said he wouldn t comment on whether he d support the hour cap contained in the senate bill you know i upon occasion work hours a week and you

airport out d glock from the block where everybody air forced out it s not about casting blame as the national transportation safety board voted tuesday to approve its final report on the amtrak derailment in philadelphia member bella dinh zarr proposed to make the absence of positive train control a main probable cause more than just a contributing factor as originally drafted the government and industry have not acted for decades on a well known safety hazard dinh zarr said suggesting that the ntsb is limiting ourselves by this institutional inertia and referring to the linear and formulaic way that probable cause is determined this isn t about casting blame it s about how we as an agency can make the greatest difference she said no go the rest of the board shot her down i don t see it as a causal factor member robert sumwalt said definitely had it been enforced in place this accident would not have occurred but i don t think it was the spark that ignited this accident sequence final recommendations our own kathy wolfe has the rundown the ntsb wants the fra to install devices and develop procedures that would help crews identify their locations in areas where ptc won t be active to collect more data about the number of crew members in a cab during an accident the board also reiterated the need for greater occupant protections including restraints and strengthened windows it also made several recommendations for improving initial and recurring training for crew multi tasking in prolonged atypical situations reaction from fra administrator sarah feinberg while congress has given railroads at least three more years to fully implement ptc the public deserves it sooner fra will continue to do everything it can to ensure this life saving technology is fully implemented as soon as possible and from sen chris murphy d conn the senate is about to pass a bill that includes million to implement ptc on more commuter railroads like metro north and i will keep fighting until it s operational on every passenger rail service in connecticut and across the country freight s response from aar s ed greenberg freight railroads have spent more than billion on ptc final costs for ptc are estimated to be about billion for freight railroads this technology is not off the shelf and isn t just about plugging in or turning on components it is a

think they discovered that it s not the case and a lot of the safety issues that were raised in some of these ig reports other types of evaluations i think have really pointed to the need for them to step up their game thune said on the continued funding question he added we have given them more money than they ve asked for in each of the three last fiscal years so i suspect that we ll evaluate

party candidateshillary clintonafter months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well financed liberal opponent hillary clinton on tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the democratic nominating fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the november election now all but certain to clinch her party s nomination mrs clinton will continue to face the criticism of her party rival senator bernie sanders of vermont but she is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading republican candidate donald j trump her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election and stepping up fund raising that has lagged in the face of mr sanders s challenge bernie sandersthe results of tuesday s five democratic presidential primaries will almost certainly force sen bernie sanders to acknowledge a hard reality it s time for plan b sanders hasn t said if he has a strategy for changing the focus of his campaign and he insists he ll continue fighting through the last contest in june but rather than insisting that victory over hillary clinton is still within reach he said after tuesday s contests that he ll go to the democratic party s national convention in july with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform republican party candidatested cruzfor ted cruz to stop donald trump from seizing the republican presidential nomination he must replicate his wisconsin victory in indiana another midwestern state

kasich donald trumpfollowing a five primary sweep tuesday night donald trump repeatedly insisted that he would beat hillary clinton so easily because she is a crooked politician and a flawed candidate whom people do not like it is undoubtedly true that clinton is beatable by her own admission she is not a natural politician but that does not mean that trump can beat her let alone easily

floridawhen alan grayson faced off against david jolly on monday night in the first debate in the race for the florida senate seat being vacated by marco rubio the match up was unique in a couple of ways for one grayson a democrat and jolly a republican haven t even won their parties nominations yet the primaries aren t until august the latest in the country for congressional seats and there are a handful of other serious candidates in the race but the more notable twist in monday s debate was the questions themselves they were posted online in advance for all to see having been determined for the most part by more than votes from internet users including more than in florida indianaanother major tea party group has backed rep marlin stutzman s r ind insurgent bid for indiana s senate seat just one week before the gop primary tea party express on tuesday announced their endorsement calling stutzman the best choice for the grassroots stutzman is facing fellow republican rep todd

determine the senate majority next year a relative newcomer to elective politics mcginty used the endorsement of president obama and more than million in spending on her behalf from outside liberal

"2016-04-29 07:24","Larry Wilmore is not joking around","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," larry wilmore is not joking aroundby glenn thrush am edtlarry wilmore really likes bernie sanders is okay with hillary clinton and finds donald trump interesting in the coded language of a comedian journalist of the liberal persuasion attempting to maintain a veneer of non partisan neutrality but when it comes to william jefferson clinton whom he quarter jokingly referred to as a super predator on the nightly show recently whoa as president of the united states he decided it was a good thing to fool around with a year old staffer monica lewinsky in the white house stone serious wilmore the keynote speaker of this weekend s white house correspondents dinner told me during an an otherwise light interview for politico s off message podcast it was predatory behavior you know added wilmore who grew up in a catholic family outside of l a i really supported the clintons politically but that really bugged me that whole clinton thing i t still does because it s not even though they both said it was consensual you re the president of the united states that s the workplace you know that s a young girl come on man you ve got a young daughter come on you don t gotta do that that s not right wilmore a low key year old writer comic and actor couldn t be more different that the man he replaced at the comedy central late desk stephen colbert who famously lit up george w bush at the dinner that roast which prompted walk outs from aghast republicans prompted event organizers to opt for less incendiary speakers like well wilmore if colbert cloaked progressive worldview behind a faux conservative suit and tie wilmore doesn t pretend to be anyone other than himself his comedy comes with an unmistakable moral edge it colors and sometimes overshadows a professional funnyman s imperative to be hilarious as his grudge against the nd proves his parents who emigrated from evanston ill to pasadena when he was kid remain a significant influence his father who worked as an l a county probation officer until his late s decided to become a doctor and willed himself through medical school while working i saw a gray s anatomy book on his table and i said what are you doing and he said you know i think i m going to change what i m doing wilmore was the class president of a nearly all white catholic school a position he joked that will make him feel right at home at the podium of saturday night s largely monochromatic dinner the whca podium has become a consequential perch for serious comedians in recent years it can accelerate a rising career colbert seth meyers lend gravitas to a lighter weight host joel mchale or expose the fault lines between entertainment and politics like the withdrawal of would be host louis c k in after greta von susteren and others savaged him for making allegedly misogynistic jokes the pressure not to bomb is intense a couple of years back i stood backstage with mchale as he paced back and forth reading his jokes aloud out of a tiny loose leaf notebook filled with laminated joke pages so most hosts affect a carefree i got here by accident attitude not wilmore he s got the guts to admit he s pushed for it since performing a well received set at the congressional correspondents dinner a few years back when he was colbert s senior black correspondent on the daily show i call it throwing it out there that i really wanted to do this you know not knowing if i d have a chance to do it or be in the position and do it but really hoping that i would he told me during a sit down in manhattan last week as he was prepping his final set with a team of writers from his show when i ask him why he wanted the gig so much he says i don t know then pauses i guess it was something that i felt would be a cool thing to have done especially to do it for president obama first black president the significance of him in that office and i just wanted to be able to have a chance to do that wilmore isn t shy about confronting racial topics on his show one of the funniest recent segments was a focus group with a handful of black trump supporters that ended with him asking them how they had lost their minds and he offers the bluntest possible explanation for his blanket obama philia well i always said i m not disappointed with obama because i voted for him because he was black and as long as he kept being black i was a happy man he said wilmore then relates the following semi made up conversation well larry what about obama s foreign policy is he still black yes then i have no problem i am good wilmore says he ll make his share of obama jokes and clinton jokes but his target of choice is duh trump he hasn t talked to colbert about the speech but as of the taping he planned to quiz meyers whose performance he considered to be his gold standard he especially loved meyers signature joke delivered to trump s disapproving chin jutted scowl that the only blacks who really liked him were a family of white family named the blacks his assault on trump was hilarious says wilmore who has tried thus far unsuccessfully to woo the billionaire developer onto his show it was so funny they kept cutting to trump and his reaction was just hilarious i mean trump s face was just it kept getting funnier and funnier and funnier yet as he professes to view as an endless tanker train of comic fuel wilmore is worried by the danger he says trump poses one of his earliest trump bits featured him grilling his writers for jokes and each one giving up saying the reality star s rise wasn t funny moreover he s not buying democratic self talk that trump will be a pushover in november and thinks a lot of voters might opt for an alternative out of sheer clinton fatigue hillary is already a known factor to people there s nothing like new about her and i think new means something when you re running for president he said it s like the clintons are coming back into the neighborhood you know and there s something about that and i m not even judging it on a political level i m just judging on just the purest human level you know there s something about a new family moving into the white house that s kind of interesting even if you didn t vote for them he said referring to the trump clan to view

"2016-05-20 10:03","POLITICO's Morning Money: Does the ITC report sell TPP short? â€” Things that make you go hmmm â€” Another hack surfaces â€” The election that everyone hates","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edtdoes the itc report sell tpp short supporters of the trans pacific partnership note that the itc report which showed only modest economic benefits also repeatedly said it could be understating tpp s impact particularly in the services sector a report for the peterson institute for international economics found a larger impact and the itc acknowledged that its model may not have captured everything the peterson report did a couple examples from the itc report u s services providers would face fewer barriers to entering new markets and would likely increase exports in services where the united states has a strong competitive advantage such as cloud computing services or express delivery services gains within these more narrowly defined industries may be substantially higher than in the more aggregated sectors available in the commission s model the impact of tpp s other provisions on the u s economy is generally difficult to quantify these provisions would likely improve the overall regulatory climate for trade and investment between the united states and the other tpp parties particularly for new fta partners university of chicago s austan goolsbee emails on the itc report i think the itc model has always been basically just manufacturing and does not including services in the old days that didn t matter almost all exports were goods but these days that dramatically understates things because the u s is the biggest service exporter in the world the peterson number includes everything as well as some other methodological differences that are definite improvements such as properly accounting for increasing returns specialization in industries i think it s widely viewed by economists as more accurate in a way it was surprising the itc number was as big as it was given the limitations things that make you go hmmm donald trump on thursday in new jersey look a lot of you don t know the world of economics and you shouldn t even bother just do me a favor leave it to me donald trump also on thursday in new jersey who the hell cares if there s a trade war how do you square these two things well you can t any u s consumer especially lower income consumers would care a lot if there was a trade war and the price of imported goods skyrocketed retaliatory tariffs from china and mexico would then crush u s exports and cost u s jobs from those working in exporting industries it would also drive up costs for american manufacturers reliant on imports for raw materials it would likely mean recession or worse but you know who cares the election that everyone hates nyt s jonathan martin and dalia sussman mr trump and mrs clinton are widely disliked by voters mr trump s and mrs clinton s soaring levels of unpopularity are extraordinary for the likely nominees of the two major parties nearly two thirds of voters for example say that mr trump is not honest and trustworthy just as many say the same of mrs clinton strong majorities of voters say the candidates do not share their values maybe none of this matters bloomberg the u s economy and american businesses are strong enough to weather the election of either donald trump or hillary clinton as president according to james dinan founder of hedge fund york capital management and a clinton donor good friday morning

principles shared by the center left and center right trump can t deport million nyt s julia preston alan rappeport and matt richtel mr trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech but experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs whoever paid and would in many ways defy the logic of science engineering and

presidentialdemocratic party candidateshillary clintonwith the democratic nominating contest entering its final stretch and her sights set on the general election hillary clinton raised roughly million in april for her primary fight her campaign said monday taking in more than her rival bernie sanders during the month mrs clinton who now has million on hand in her campaign also raised an additional million for democratic candidates and state parties nationwide through a joint fund raising program with the democratic national committee that program allows for some of that money to also be used for mrs clinton s campaign thanks to million people across the country we have the resources we need to continue to run a winning primary campaign while preparing for the general election said robby mook mrs clinton s campaign manager the fund raising brings the total mrs clinton has raised in primary funds to million compared to million for mr sanders but mrs clinton s impressive total has been met with scrutiny for her reliance on high dollar events with wall street executives while mr sanders has largely raised his money online through small dollar donations bernie sanderssenator bernie sanders of vermont plans to spend monday campaigning across indiana holding three rallies on the final day before the state primary and hoping to pull off a win after a tough week of election losses and campaign layoffs a win in indiana where mr sanders and hillary clinton are in a tight race could help mr sanders regain some momentum and an nbc news wall street journal marist poll released on sunday showed them in a virtual tie in the state at a rally on sunday night in south bend ind mr sanders told thousands of supporters that he saw the state as important to helping him win the nomination still last week amid staff reductions he began focusing less on attacking mrs clinton and more on his views for shaping the democratic party republican party candidatested cruza rowdy voice rose up from the crowd you suck the young man shouted at republican white house hopeful ted cruz as he was making the case for a one page tax return during a late sunday evening rally in northern indiana cruz shook his head and briefly deviated from his polished campaign speech while local police found the protester and escorted from him la porte s city auditorium a grand s venue that teemed with supporters of the texas republican apparently the young man is having some problems the senator said i appreciate you sharing your views hopefully someone has told you is that children should actually speak with respect cruz said at his fourth campaign event of his sunday his voice was scratchy from yet another long day trying to catch a break john kasichohioans especially ohio republicans want gov john kasich to drop out of the presidential race a new poll out today shows nearly half percent of ohio voters say it s time for kasich to drop out of the race for the republican nomination compared to only percent who want him to stay in among republican voters percent want him to drop out the poll is from democratic leaning public policy polling but the same firm found a month ago that percent of ohioans wanted kasich to stay in the race since winning ohio s primary march kasich has endured a string of losses long mathematically eliminated from winning on the first ballot he says he is hoping to win at a contested convention donald trumpfirst donald trump called mexicans rapists now he s throwing in china too the hate spewing huckster told a rally crowd in

mention the asdc spring meeting the dncc will provide shuttles to the sheraton downtown where all meetings will be held friday may dear colleagues democrats in every state have an historic opportunity for success in the races for the white house the senate supreme court congress governors legislators county and local offices could all see great gains there is limited time to prepare for this election every minute matters as we build an effective national grassroots effort for success in moving our shared values forward at every level that said in some states activists are calling for state party conventions to eliminate automatic unpledged delegates super delegates while they can pass a resolution calling on the dnc to take such action in the future state parties do not have the authority to bind their delegates the process to change the charter must first go through the dncâ s rules and bylaws committee and then go to the full democratic national committee for a vote even if the convention votes to change the charter there are numerous ideas and suggestions on the issue of â super delegatesâ i believe all deserve due consideration but since an actual change cannot occur prior to the november election i respectfully encourage this conversation occur after november this election is just too importanthere is the dnc charter charter article section prohibits the binding of any delegate to vote against their personal preference charter article section all changes must be approved by dnc membership bylaws article section c all changes must go to rules and by laws committee for consideration before any action by dnc can occur as we continue to educate our local activists on the process and rules that serve as the foundation of our party i hope that we can move

meted out a special kind of justice for jeffrey epstein larded with fawning obsequiousness secret dealings and an astoundingly lenient sentence after all billionaires even billionaire sex abusers aren t like you and me investigators documented that at least underage girls some as young as were repeatedly exploited by epstein and his buddies for their carnal amusement at his palm beach mansion from to according to court documents the girls were required to administer topless or nude massage while mr epstein masturbated himself occasionally the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse state and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of federal and state sex crimes to two state charges soliciting prostitution and procuring a person younger than for prostitution meanwhile the feds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges they granted immunity to his various co conspirators the federal prosecutors who seemed cowed by epstein s high powered attorneys including roy black kenneth starr and alan dershowitz worked out the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser would be spared federal charges the failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal lawsuit filed in west palm beach against the u s attorney s office in by two of the young women identified as jane doe no and jane doe no on wednesday their attorneys filed a page motion demanding a summary judgment in their favor whether or not u s district judge kenneth marra grants the motion the document along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic emails and letters from prosecutors to epstein s legal team sure as hell prove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the u s justice system the correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet plea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of it one exchange suggested that he plead guilty in miami which would hopefully cut the press coverage significantly no wonder epstein received a piddling month sentence for a crime that got less exalted sex offenders in florida or years hard time his less than hard time amounted to months in the palm beach county stockade except he was allowed to spend hours a day six days a week at his nicely appointed office as part of a work release program he then served the balance of his sentence under house arrest quite an imposition for someone with a luxury mansion on the barrier island consider that this occurred at a time when low rent sex offenders were forced to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath miami s julia tuttle causeway without water toilets electricity of course super rich epstein managed to avoid such indignities nowadays the convict

for getting kennedy family member william kennedy smith acquitted of charges of rape in he has also represented kelsey grammer race car driver helio castroneves girls gone wild creator joe francis and conservative radio commentator rush limbaugh the year old pop star who is canadian is being charged with dui driving without a valid driver s license out of the state of georgia and resisting arrest without violence jeffrey epstein attorney roy black denies allegations in letter by ex u s attorney alexander acostaattorney roy black is disputing claims that he and other attorneys representing jeffrey epstein pried into federal prosecutors personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender black also denies epstein s attorneys negotiated in bad faith while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors in a written response tuesday to the palm beach daily news black disputes claims made against epstein s defense team by former u s attorney alexander acosta those and other allegations by acosta were contained in a three page letter printed friday in the online publication the daily beast acosta was the u s attorney for the southern district of florida at the time epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple sex crimes with minor girls black the miami attorney who successfully defended william kennedy smith against rape charges was part of epstein s legal dream team epstein was never charged with a federal crime he and his attorneys struck a deal with federal prosecutors which was outlined in a non prosecution agreement according to the agreement epstein had to plead guilty to two state charges register as a lifelong sex offender and serve months in jail if he successfully completed those terms and served one year of probation then epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related to approximately to victims in a written response to the daily news black said we did present argument after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against mr epstein was unsupported by the evidence we detailed the so called evidence during many meetings with prosecutors and agents we were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our investigation and i believe we made a convincing case why charges were not appropriate i still believe that today according to acosta now dean of the florida international university college of law federal prosecutors and agents met with black in the summer of the prosecutors presented epstein a choice plead guilty to state felony charges resulting in two years imprisonment registration as a sex offender and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial what followed acosta said was that epstein s defense team launched a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors i use the word assault intentionally as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which i or the prosecutors in my office had previously encountered acosta said in his letter among the legal superstars on epstein s defense team harvard professor alan dershowitz kenneth starr jay lefkowitz and several others including prosecutors who had formally worked in the u s attorney s office and in the child exploitation and obscenity section of the justice department acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him the office s excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter black said he s never heard anyone mention writing a book about the epstein case mr acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the department of justice in washington black said any person under investigation by a united states attorney meaning any of the such offices in the country has the right to seek review by the department of justice and it is so provided for in their manual thus i cannot imagine invoking this right could be construed as bad faith in our system of justice people are given the right of appeal and there should be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it finally mr acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecutors black said i am not sure what he refers to but this never happened we did point out misconduct and over reaching by certain people involved in the investigation not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a necessary part of the process there will always be people who abuse the great power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occurs the non prosecution agreement was sealed in epstein s state felony file until victims attorneys successfully argued to make the document public in september palm beach daily news march a rod escalates war with yankees team responds with a challenge embattled yankee alex rodriguez escalated his war with team higher ups via comments from his new new york lawyer suggesting the team purposely mistreated him medically and yankees president randy levine responded saturday afternoon with a strong challenge for rodriguez levine offered to release all the team s medical records while simultaneously asking a rod to release his records of treatment with anthony galea the disgraced sports doctor who treated rodriguez and was convicted of smuggling hgh reputation rush limbaugh s defense attorney roy black hosts fundraiser for patrick murphy memo to patrick murphy if you want to win street cred with the percent don t have rush limbaugh s lawyer host your fundraiser murphy the democratic congressional candidate hoping to unseat u s rep allen west has opened himself up to a lot of bad jokes with the fundraiser slated for tomorrow night in coral gables the event is being held at the home of roy black the famed criminal attorney who defended rush limbaugh when palm beach prosecutors accused him of doctor shopping for pain pills black is currently representing john goodman the wellington polo mogul accused of driving drunk and causing a car accident that killed a year old last year guests at black s home will shell out to for the soiree they ll also get to rub shoulders with a genuine celebrity black s wife lea who has been a cast member on the real housewives of miami just to recap republican allen west defends tax breaks for the wealthy and democrat

international polo club palm beach founder john goodman whose alleged killing of a year old man in a car crash last month is still under investigation was nowhere to be found among those who paid homage to high profile south florida attorney roy black funny thing because when it comes to celebrities attending the blacks annual gala in miami beach saturday night black and his wife lea can always count on those he extracted from the criminal justice system and yes there may be some of future clients of black s there too girls gone wild s joe francis was one of them he once had tax and public morals problems but black made it all better so he came to the fontainebleau miami beach for the big party he wins every case francis said his approach is different from other lawyers partly because he never worked for the government as a prosecutor he believes in your case percent and i don t know any other who does that three time indianapolis and dancing with the stars winner helio castroneves showed up black got him out of his little tax evasion issue last year yet john goodman who could soon be facing dui and manslaughter accusations but hasn t been charged was mia and who

this party has failed the blacks party which could rival most palm beach shindigs in the wealth and notoriety of participants has long been a staple of miami s social life and it raises millions for educational charities it gathers usually well known figures from all facets of life the legal community for example was represented with the likes of harvard prof alan dershowitz who represented palm

her husband he s a brilliant attorney who has extraordinary admiration of a lot of people the governor said of black he s a hard worker and those usually get lucky well there was one failure that

uninsured","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edta house subcommittee debates whether cms should kill a controversial demo and researchers find that the nation s uninsured level just hit a historic new low but first a major development in the zika funding fight looms today senate on verge of approving zika request the senate is likely to approve a billion zika funding package today as part of a transportation funding bill but that s not the whole story where they stand democratic sen patty murray one of the amendment s crafters told pulse she is hopeful of passage republican sen richard burr told us that he s a yes too and he expects enough republican support however several republicans told us yesterday evening that they were still reviewing the language and not ready to commit to approval what else is on tap the senate will also vote on an amendment to fully fund the billion white house request and not pay for it which is expected to get democratic support and a billion package that is funded with aca cuts among other pay fors which will get gop support but democratic backing is unlikely house targeting lower level of zika funding house appropriators on monday introduced a million emergency funding bill responding to the zika virus outbreak about a third of what the white house has sought to combat the mosquito borne virus house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers said the bill which draws on million in unspent ebola funds and another million in hhs s administrative budget and does not include new money will be taken up by his committee this week the white house has failed to justify its budget request rogers said democrats say gop is playing zika politics with clean water act a house gop bill called the zika vector control act contains the same language as the reducing regulatory burdens act which creates exemptions to the clean water act s restrictions on pesticide use the legislation which is on the suspension calendar for tuesday has nothing to do with zika and everything to do with republicans relentless special interest attacks on the clean water act said drew hammill spokesman for house democratic leader nancy pelosi it is shameful that house republicans have decided the zika crisis is nothing more than an opportunity to eliminate protections for the water our children drink the mosquito control association disagrees with democrats in a letter the not for profit group offers its enthusiastic support for republicans measure this amendment addresses a situation that has placed mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy the association wrote on monday mosquito control programs are vulnerable to lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the clean water act where fines may be up to per day for activities that do not involve harm to the environment this is tuesday pulse where we re truly wondering if sen marco rubio is going to do chest or legs at the gym today tips to ddiamond politico com or ddiamond on twitter especially if you re a source close to the senator with help from brianna ehley briannaehley jen haberkorn jenhab and sarah karlin smith sarahkarlin preview today s hearing on the future of the part b demo the a m house energy and commerce health subcommittee hearing isn t likely to go cms s way nearly all house republicans have signed on to a letter seeking to kill the demonstration to test new ways to pay for physician administered drugs and the committee plans to discuss rep larry bucshon s bill to end the project what you ll hear misguided ill conceived and harmful will be some of the negative refrains from witnesses along with the verb withdraw but the hearing may be more balanced than some might have thought two of the five witnesses offered strong support for the part b demo in prepared testimony pro s sarah karlin notes my personal catch is that while drugs are keeping me alive i am going through my savings at an alarming rate said heather block a stage four cancer patient in prepared testimony in all the uproar over this proposal i have yet to hear anyone say that the current system is working joe baker president of the medicare rights center said the demonstration must move forward if the government wants to achieve its overall goal of transitioning medicare to a system that reimburses for health care based on value a concept supported by many of the part b demo s detractors including physicians and hospitals even critics of the demo want changes to drug prices michael schweitz the national advocacy chair for the coalition of state rheumatology organizations and an opponent of the proposal wrote that the increases in drug prices are unsustainable for medicare and beneficiaries but

remanded the case on monday telling the lower courts to find a solution that allows religious institutions to object to providing birth control but also keeps intact obamacare s coverage protections just percent of americans are uninsured that s according to new national health interview survey estimates out today and it represents the lowest uninsured level on record the survey which goes

delivery","morningdefense@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by jeremy herb am edtwith louis nelson austin wright connor o brien and ellen mitchelldriving the day congress negotiates defense bills behind closed doors the senate armed services committee and house defense appropriations subcommittee take their debates of the annual defense policy and spending bills behind closed doors the senate panel begins work on the national defense authorization act likely to stretch into thursday or friday while the house subcommittee should have a fairly quick markup at p m ahead of full committee consideration which will be open here s a look at both bills house defense spending bill boost procurement blocks army cuts the house defense spending bill released tuesday evening includes an additional billion from the war budget moved to cover base pentagon programs echoing a similar move by the house armed services committee with the extra money the bill boosts procurement funding by billion including an additional f fighters and f a super hornets as well as a third littoral combat ship the spending measure also reverses the army s planned end strength cuts and funds a full percent military pay raise the full bill is here and a summary is here the measure s funding tables will be released ahead of the full appropriations committee markup democrats slam funding gimmick in a sign of the looming defense spending fight house appropriations ranking democrat nita lowey of new york issued a statement tuesday slamming the bill s funding maneuver as a gimmick and astoundingly irresponsible by shifting funding away from overseas contingency operations the majority would create a cliff just a few months into forcing the new president to request supplemental funds to pay our troops within weeks after taking office she said in a statement sasc defense policy bill bans brac includes lower pay raise the six sasc subcommittees approved their portions of the ndaa monday and tuesday with three of them holding open sessions that teased out a few details of the full senate bill the bill would ban a new round of base closures requested by the pentagon for the fifth straight year said sen kelly ayotte r n h the readiness chairwoman i do not want to give the department the open ended authority to pursue another brac round that will incur significant up front costs ayotte said personnel subcommittee chairman lindsey graham r s c said the bill includes a lower than projected pay raise of percent rather than percent approved by the house he also added that the bill includes provisions overhauling the military s health care system aimed at sustainability higher quality better access and expand the services and the changes he suggested could be opposed by veterans and military service organizations bill likely to require women to register for the draft the senate armed services version of the defense policy bill is likely to include a provision requiring women to register for the draft i believe it will be in the mark sen claire mccaskill d mo told morning d tuesday the defense bill mark from senate armed services chairman john mccain r ariz has not yet been made public but if the provision remains after the committee completes its markup it would follow the house armed services committee where the requirement was added in as an amendment although there are efforts to remove it on the house floor senate appropriations not far behind our budget and appropriations colleagues report that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday the defense authorization and appropriations measures are in the senate floor queue the kentucky republican said they re both likely to be considered after the senate finishes the energy and water appropriations bill and then the transportation hud and military construction va bill which will be coupled together happy wednesday and welcome to morning defense where the coffee is already flowing

berets decision on the day chuck hagel was nominated for defense secretary we submitted a freedom of information act request for his communications with the pentagon from to during his time as a republican senator from nebraska we were hoping these letters would shed some light on his views on key issues of the past decade on tuesday three and a half years later we got a large envelope in the mail with a stack of letters from hagel to then defense secretaries donald rumsfeld and robert gates given that hagel has now been out of the government for more than a year the letters no longer have much news value except as evidence of the pentagon s less than punctual foia system but there are a few gems worth noting in hagel sent gates a letter recommending his former senate aide eric rosenbach to be deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence rosenbach didn t get the job but he s done pretty well for himself nonetheless serving in several top pentagon posts including now as carter s chief of staff hagel also sent several letters asking about iraq war issues and he twice wrote rumsfeld to urge funding to repair a runway at offutt air force base back home in nebraska in hagel sent rumsfeld a pretty direct handwritten note complaining about then army chief of staff eric shinseki s decision to make black berets a part of the army combat uniform a move that was unpopular among soldiers and has since been reversed dear don hagel wrote i hope you personally are taking a look at this dumb black beret decision made by general shinseki i expressed my displeasure with this silly decision to cohen and shinseki one dumb decision after the other over there first black berets then the army of one slogan what the hell is next i sent the president a note on this

again","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edtwelcome to jobs day the april jobs report could dip below k but it s not expected to be a disaster and wages could rise a bit faster moody s mark zandi i expect payroll employment to increase by in april unemployment to decline to percent and average hourly earnings to increase by percent the expected april job gain is a bit on the soft side reflecting the weak adp data for the month the adp data overstates any weakness in the month due to a technical issue but it is still signaling that hiring slowed a bit abstracting from the monthly vagaries of the data the job market remains very strong job growth has averaged well over per month for almost years the job market is enjoying the longest streak of consecutive monthly job gains on record the only blemish are layoffs in the energy industry and trade sensitive manufacturing pantheon s ian shepherdson barring some sort of out of the blue shock we are much more interested in the hourly earnings data today than the headline payroll number the key question is the extent to which wages rebound after being depressed by a persistent calendar quirk in both february and march we think a percent increase is required to return the level of hourly earnings to trend marginally above the consensus forecast percent clinton looks to poach gop donors politico s ben white with ken vogel annie karni isaac arnsdorf and eli stokols hillary clinton s supporters in recent days have been making a furious round of calls to top bush family donors to try to convince them that she represents their values better than donald trump multiple sources in both parties told politico the moves come as clinton and the democratic party try to take advantage of deep unease among establishment republicans on wall street and elsewhere with trump s emergence as the presumptive republican nominee top targets for the clinton team include people like woody johnson jeb bush s former finance chair and the owner of the new york jets one person close to clinton said supporters of the former secretary of state drew up a list of wall street donors who supported jeb bush and other unsuccessful republican candidates months ago but wanted to wait until trump locked down the nomination before beginning to make the calls intense battle for wall street cash the race for wall street cash will be intense trump said this week that while he would help fund a general election campaign that could cost well over billion for each candidate he will also seek donations on thursday trump named steven mnuchin head of private investment firm dune capital management and a former partner at goldman sachs as his national finance chairman mnuchin himself has donated to clinton in the past highlighting the politically ambidextrous nature of many wall street donors but mnuchin s hiring could open wall street doors for trump that might otherwise be closed making the clinton effort event more important two major bush donors who received calls from clinton supporters said they would not switch their allegiance to the likely democratic nominee despite misgivings about trump s ability to win and his rhetoric on trade immigration and government spending but both suggested it was a smart play for clinton supporters to try and peel off establishment republicans who might otherwise grudgingly support trump goldman hedged again goldman sachs now has a former partner high up in the clinton campaign gary gensler and the trump campaign mnuchin mnuchin s hiring should theoretically make it very hard for trump to slam clinton s ties to wall street but like everything with trump he will do it anyway and probably get away with it why ryan scorned trump politico s jake sugar mag sherman for the past four months as trump soared in the polls ryan has watched warily a ban on muslims in the u s that s not what this country is about he said a hesitance to disavow white supremacists really trump even blasted free trade agreements pacts that ryan strongly supports but after repeating the standard line for months that he would support the party s nominee the country s

wonâ t allow that come fall they will either distance themselvesâ and risk alienating trump supportersâ or stay silent and then get forced to own it remember trump also brags about never changing

forwarded message all house democratic chairman xavier becerra the highest ranking latino member of congress and a surrogate for secretary hillary clinton spoke with jorge ramos yesterday about the state of the presidential race please find a clip below followed by q amp a excerpts in which they discuss republicans for donald trump senator sanders decision to stay in the race the chairman s support for secretary clinton donald trump s hateful rhetoric and its impact on voter turnoutq amp a excerpts ramos let me just begin with the republicans finally speaker ryan met with donald trump and of course they don t agree on many things but finally there was a press release in which they both agreed to make sure that hillary clinton doesn t become the next president what do you think of that becerra first one if you scratch below the surface of donald trump what do you find congressional republicans so it should not surprise people that the congressional leadership is getting on board with donald trump the second thing it tells you is this republicans are more concerned about their party politics than they are about their principles because for them to have said all of these negative things about donald trump and how they could not associate with donald trump and now they re saying he s their leader it shows you that they are so driven by the politics that they are willing to give up on their principles ramos let me ask you about the democrats bernie sanders campaign manager said in an interview that democrats have to choose the best candidate to beat donald trump and that according to the polls sanders would do much better than hillary clinton does he have a point becerra he has handled his campaign very very well he has animated excited a lot voters and i believe that is going to be helpful going into november for our democrats i think it is pretty certain though that hilary clinton is our nominee i m working very hard on her behalf to make sure she s our next president ramos are you worried about her emails that you might get a surprise in the middle of the summer or after the conventions becerra from everything i ve seen here in congress we ve had hearings over these things for quite some time with all the testimony i don t see that there s anything there as the secretary said it is good that the fbi is doing a thorough investigation she has welcomed that she has testified my sense is we re going to keep talking about the real issues making sure americans are working making sure they re getting paid better wages making sure everyone has health care and certainly making sure that we tackle immigration reform ramos in the last debate hillary clinton and bernie sanders they both promised us that they would not deport children nor immigrants who don t have a criminal record do you think if she becomes president she will be able to keep that promise becerra i do believe so especially if she is able to get a congress that works with her to pass immigration reform so this way she won t have to rely on executive action the way president obama has had to rely on it because you had a situation where he had to make a system that s broken work the best it could so i think that if the secretary becoming president gets us immigration reform quickly we won t have these situations had we passed the senate immigration bill three years ago jorge we would not be dealing with this crisis at the border with children this way it s a humanitarian crisis many of us have spoken to the immigration we are asking that the administration realize that the people from central america are coming as a result of a crisis it s a humanitarian crisis and we have to deal with it appropriately ramos recently i m sure you read that story in the new york times they suggested that you are on a short list of possible vice presidential candidates how does that work has someone from the campaign talked to you about it becerra i wish i could tell you i ve been considered before for vice president and i could tell you how it works i have no idea how it works and all i know is i m going to keep working to try to help elect secretary clinton ramos as you know donald trump has nicknames for everyone do you have a nickname for donald trump becerra la trompa what else can i tell you ramos do you want to do the translation for that becerra all you know is he says one thing but then does another i don t know about folks who are watching but the last thing you want is someone who s making major decisions to always be able to say one thing and do another ramos sixteen republican candidates underestimated donald trump and you know they all lost do you think democrats are making the same mistake that they are underestimating donald trump becerra jorge i think i may have even said this to you in an interview but i know i ve said this very early on when trump first came out with his very insulting comments about latinos and immigrants i said you know what we need to hear this it is good to have this out in the open because if this doesn t cause us as latinos as families of immigrants to come out and vote and be supportive of those who are with us then i can t tell you we re going to have success on immigration reform i can t tell you we re going to do the best job of increasing wages we need to see that this out there so those that attack us will see we respond ramos congressman becerra thank you for talking with us cid a a "

crowleyin his address to an elite invitation only washington foreign policy audience wednesday donald trump promised that as president he would restore a coherent vision to america s role in the world but across the ideological spectrum and even among natural allies trump s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that trump is up to the job it struck me as a very odd mishmash said doug bandow a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian cato institute who shares many of trump s beliefs about scaling back america s role abroad he called for a new foreign policy strategy but you don t really get the sense he gave one trump s speech was lacking in policy prescriptions and its strident rhetoric masked a lack of depth said robert bud mcfarlane a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan who attended the speech speaking at washington s mayflower hotel trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign including promises to cut better trade deals with china swiftly defeat the islamic state rebuild the military and reduce the expense america incurs in upholding international security from europe to asia trump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies he also unveiled a new theme saying that the u s would finally have a coherent foreign policy based on narrow self interest economic gain and global stability but trump offered few specifics about his strategy focusing on the alleged disasters created by past presidents and a foreign policy establishment who frankly don t know what they re doing even though they may look awfully good writing for the new york times or talking on television trump said he would surround himself with talented experts and new people to help him chart a global strategy but even though he said on msnbc s morning joe earlier in the day that i ll be naming them today he did not do so the audience was heavier on celebrity journalists like bob woodward and jake tapper than on the sort of prominent foreign policy thinkers and former government officials typically present at similar appearances by presidential candidates trump has largely been shunned by foreign policy veterans of past republican administrations more than members of whom recently signed an open letter saying they would not join his administration some have threatened to vote for hillary clinton over trump in november one notable figure sitting in the front row as trump repeated his call for better relations with moscow i believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia from a position of strength is possible common sense says this cycle of hostility must end trump said was russia s ambassador to washington sergey kislyak trump made some intriguing points but we need to understand what is meant in the implementation kislyak told politico after the speech it needs to be started carefully also in attendance was a trump foreign policy adviser walid phares a lebanese maronite christian who applauded vigorously when trump said the u s had left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide the address was hosted by the national interest magazine an intellectual journal not often spotted on trump s private jet but which promotes the so called realist school of foreign policy which holds that the u s should pursue narrowly defined security interests with little concern for missions like promoting democracy or overthrowing repressive regimes some of trump s speech aligned with realist theory including his disdain for u s interventions in the arab world and what he called the dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy under a trump presidency he said no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries but experts called trump s speech rife with internal tensions he declared that america first would be the major and overriding theme of his presidency moments before hailing america s role in world war ii which was opposed by the isolationist america first movement of the early s he trashed president barack obama for failing to follow through with his threatened september air strikes in syria while also lamenting the chaos that has followed u s military interventions in iraq and libya and trump vowed to mend ties with u s allies who are fearful that america is withdrawing from the world while insisting they pay more for their own security there s just no way to reconcile these two statements it certainly won t reassure anyone internationally or anyone within the republican foreign policy establishment wright added but trump is also trying to broaden his electoral support and some analysts said that the view of elites matters less than the populist soundbites about u s military and economic strength repeating on cable television wednesday afternoon and evening trump s complaint that america s nato allies are not paying their fair share to support the european security alliance does echo at least one influential foreign policy thinker barack obama who in his address in hanover germany this week scoldedeuropeans for being complacent about their own defense obama has also complained about free riders from europe to the arab middle east enjoying the benefits of u s protection without spending or risking more themselves obama has not however explicitly threatened to let these countries defend themselves as trump did wednesday not everyone was totally dismissive of the manhattan mogul s appearance including zalmay khalilzad a former u s ambassador and national interest board member who introduced trump on wednesday he offered a coherent framework not totally outside the mainstream american foreign policy debate said khalilzad who held several senior foreign policy posts in the george w bush administration including ambassador to iraq and to afghanistan of course he added expectations were low trump also left the hawkish republican right

gallego a democrat has made a crucial adjustment to his strategy â weâ re asking people if they have a driverâ s license â he said â weâ re having those basic conversations about ids at the front end right at our first meeting with voters â since their inception a decade ago voter identification laws have been the focus of fierce political and social debate proponents largely republican argue that the regulations are essential tools to combat election fraud while critics contend that they are mainly intended to suppress turnout of democratic leaning constituencies like minorities and students as the general election nears â in which new or strengthened voter id laws will be in place in texas and other states for the first time in a presidential election â recent academic research indicates that the requirements restrict turnout and disproportionately affect voting by minorities the laws are also as in the case of mr gallego reshaping how many campaigns are run â with candidates not only spending time to secure votes but also time to ensure those votes can be cast â what voters hear is that you need to have an id â said mark p jones of the baker institute an author of the study â but they donâ t get the second part that says if you have one of these types of ids youâ re o k â after mr gallegoâ s narrow loss in researchers from the baker institute and the university of houstonâ s hobby center for public policy polled registered voters in the district who sat out the election all were asked why they did not vote rating on a scale of to from a list of seven explanations â being ill having transportation problems being too busy being out of town lacking interest disliking the candidates and lacking a required photo identification nearly percent said the main reason was that they were too busy at the other end percent said the main reason was lacking a proper photo id with another percent citing it as one reason most surprising however was what researchers found when they double checked that response the vast majority of those who claimed not to have voted because they lacked a proper id actually possessed one but did not know it moreover dr jones of the baker institute said â the confused voters said they would have voted overwhelmingly for gallego â whether such voters would have changed the outcome of the election is unknown but mr gallego said the issue goes far beyond how the laws affect individual races â itâ s tremendously undemocratic in a democratic society when you deliberately disenfranchise thousands of people â he said â turnout is good for the system â in texas more than people are eligible to vote or are already registered but have no acceptable photo id according to an analysis admitted as evidence in in a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the stateâ s law gov greg abbott of texas who defended the stateâ s voter id law against legal challenges when he served as attorney general from to says the lawâ s id requirements have maintained election integrity and have not disenfranchised voters â as the supreme court has already held the voter id requirement is no more burdensome than other voting requirements including registering to vote â ciara matthews a spokeswoman for mr abbott said in a statement â that minimal burden is far outweighed by the stateâ s compelling interest in protecting elections and voter confidence in the outcome of those elections â texas officials say they are spending millions of dollars to help voters understand and meet the new id requirements including deploying mobile offices to help citizens apply for election ids â we just havenâ t seen any large scale problem â said alicia pierce the communications director for the texas secretary of state but in wisconsin todd allbaugh resigned as chief of staff to a leading republican state senator last year after attending a party caucus in which he said some legislators â were literally giddyâ over the effect of the stateâ s voter id law on minorities and college students â i remember when republicans were the ones who helped johnson pass the civil rights bill in the â s â not democrats â mr allbaugh said in an interview last week â i went down to the office and said â iâ m done i canâ t support this party any more â â to enter a voting booth in texas one of the following is required a texas driverâ s license a texas election or personal id card a texas license to carry a handgun a military id a passport or a citizenship card people without the required identification can cast a provisional ballot but they must produce an approved id within six days or their ballot will be nullified the lawâ s critics say the list is notable for what government documents it does not include â a texas university student id a tribal identity card or a state employee id to cite three examples that could be more likely used by democratic voters than by republicans mr abbott perhaps the lawâ s most ardent backer has said that voter fraud â aboundsâ in texas a review of some fraud charges in texas between and about eight cases a year turned up instances of buying votes and setting up fake residences to vote critics of the law note that no more than three or four infractions would have been prevented by the voter id law nationally fraud that could be stopped by ids is almost nonexistent said lorraine c minnite author of the book â the myth of voter fraud â to sway an election she said it would require persuading perhaps thousands of people to commit felonies by misrepresenting themselves â and do it undetected â itâ s ludicrous â she said â itâ s not an effective way to try to corrupt an election â that is misleading said zoltan l hajnal a political science professor at the university of california san diego and an author of the study on photo id laws and minority turnout the relevant question he said is how minority turnout in states with photo id laws compares with that in states without such laws his study which relied on a sample of more than verified voters collected annually since reached a stark conclusion â weâ re finding typically that strict voter id laws double or triple the gap in turnout between whites and nonwhites â he said the texas law also has a smaller but potentially significant consequence many voters who cast provisional ballots â because they either lack an id or forgot theirs on election day â never return with proper documents to make their votes count for example in harris county which includes houston and is the stateâ s largest county only of provisional voters later produced proper ids in three elections in and finlay k mccracken a history major at trinity university in san antonio was among those whose vote went uncounted in november on election day three months after moving there from virginia he presented an unexpired virginia driverâ s license and a voter registration card at his polling place and was told neither was acceptable â itâ s a valid id â

HoughtonK@dnc.org,  ReynoldsL@dnc.org,  DaceyA@dnc.org"," a good story for us also no dws criticisms included by juliet eilperinapril at pmbarack obama rose to prominence as a different kind of democrat an outsider who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate course eight years later the president finds himself working hard to restore a party from which he was once eager to stand apart obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party than any two term president since world war ii and represents one last opportunity for him to reverse that trend but it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with establishing his own political base outside the democratic national committee and has downsized the scale of political operations inside the white house the first big tests of the rebuilding efforts comes tuesday in pennsylvania where obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested democratic primaries endorsing senate hopeful katie mcginty and josh shapiro a montgomery county official and early supporter of his who is hoping to become state attorney general should democrats claim those two offices in the fall it would represent a small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party below the presidential level under obama s watch between and democrats lost senate seats house seats state legislative seats governorships and state legislative chambers according to data compiled by university of virginia professor larry j sabato the only president in the past years who comes close is dwight d eisenhower who saw a similar decline for the gop during his time in office the republican party is arguably stronger now than they ve ever been in years despite not having the white house said simon rosenberg a longtime democratic operative and president of ndn a liberal think tank democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition obama galvanized in and then reassembled in will turn out when he is no longer on the ballot the current democratic presidential primary contest has so far fractured that coalition with young people flocking to sen bernie sanders of vermont while many voters of color especially older ones back former secretary of state hillary clinton many factors have contributed to republicans gains on the state and federal level including a concerted push by their donors to target state races and a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congressional district lines obama s defenders contend that after major victories in and it was predictable that democrats would lose significant ground in the midterm elections of and but they add the president s two successful white house bids have vastly upgraded the party s voter outreach infrastructure by expanding the national voter file the democratic national committee first started in and they point to the huge increases in the number of democratic campaign volunteers from roughly in to million in as evidence of that upgrade barack obama has single handedly modernized the democrats ability to wage campaigns on the local level said jim messina who managed obama s reâ election campaign rosenberg agrees saying that the president built on the work of bill clinton the only other two term democratic president of the last generation clinton established the intellectual framework for the democratic party and obama modernized its politics rosenberg said what isn t there yet is a large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it on some of obama s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for democrats organizing for action ofa the nonprofit group that grew out of obama s campaign operation has continued to compete with the democratic national committee for democratic dollars first as a parallel organization within the dnc and then as a separate entity in the first six months of the dnc raised million while ofa raised million and this was at a time when the dnc was carrying more than million in debt those fiscal constraints meant the dnc had to curtail the money it provided to state parties a practice that dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz d fla reversed in by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each state from a month to close cooperation has taken time ofa gave the dnc limited access to its list of supporters starting in but it turned over the entire list only in august now according to nevada democratic party chair roberta lange that voter file is used by everyone in our state while many ofa volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local political battles the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts for diverting resources during a gathering of democratic governors in washington according to multiple attendees one governor asked a senior presidential political adviser will the ofa please join the democratic party but this white house unlike that of bill clinton has always kept its political operation on a separate track under clinton the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs and the president got a political briefing once a week by contrast obama limited election activity in the white house a reflection of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of white house chief of staff denis mcdonough who has little campaign experience outside of working on obama s first presidential bid obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the operation to his chicago campaign headquarters he appointed david simas who directs the white house office of political strategy and outreach to his current position only in january after congressional democrats complained they did not have a direct white house contact for political matters obama s senior political advisers from his first term messina david plouffe and david axelrod among others have left to focus on ventures in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day to day democratic politics plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on but acknowledged that obama s relationship with his top political operatives didn t automatically translate to other candidates you don t do your best work being a mercenary said plouffe now a strategic adviser to the car service firm uber he added that it will take the commitment of wealthy democratic donors not just top party officials to target state contests the way republicans have i think we all agree something has to be done he said the question is how it s not going to be the dnc obama for his part has set limits for what he will do in connection with super pacs while in office while he did fundraising events for the one that backed his reelection campaign priorities usa mcdonough and obama s lawyers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the senate majority pac a similar entity supporting senate democrats in an april memo to then senate majority leader harry m reid d nev the pac s counsel marc e elias stipulated that to avoid any conflict of interest obama would not actually ask potential senate majority pac donors for money even when appearing at one of the group s events after making this point on the memo s first page he reiterated two pages later with underlined emphasis again to be clear the president will not solicit contributions at or in connection with any of these meetings after a protracted and bitter exchange reid s aides abandoned their effort to involve obama in any more than a few super pac events and the president agreed to transfer million from the dnc to both the democratic senatorial campaign committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee in the fall of during the cycle the dnc made no transfers to the two committees but with his popularity high among democrats and no election ahead of him obama has been working to shore up his party both financially and politically and his aides say obama has turned controversial issues including immigration gay rights and climate change to the democrats advantage he will be aggressive from the presidential level down to the state and local representative level simas said there s going to be a democratic nominee and democratic candidates they are the ones who are going to be driving the campaigns and the president will be there to be as helpful as possible recently in dallas before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of dollars to the democratic senatorial campaign committee obama diagnosed one of the problems democrats just aren t very good at focusing on down ballot races he said according to two participants the president may have been stating the obvious but it reflected a shift in thinking among democrats who are working furiously to shore up state level candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting since obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the dnc and both congressional committees doing more than events for the dnc alone sen charles e schumer n y the second ranking democrat in the senate said that when he asked obama to make a series of primary endorsements this cycle including one of mcginty he just did it with no muss no fuss in a very great way in december the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint redistricting strategy and obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal for the democratic governors association in january even former members such as rep barney frank d mass have been asked to attend fundraisers on behalf of state lawmakers in states such as ohio we have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making those investments said rep steve israel d n y adding that while house democrats will have a very strong wind at their backs this year the day after this election we have to understand that the wind s going to be in our faces in many democrats in conservative states were eager to tap obama s fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side by side with a president with sagging popularity ratings already is different longtime democratic strategist donna brazile said that for a long time democrats wanted obama s resources including money and analytics but they didn t want his presence when she called the white house last year to ask if the president would do robocalls to african american voters during louisiana s special election for governor white house officials seemed surprised that democrat john bel edwards even wanted their help brazile assured them that he did and democrats increasingly believe that they will need obama in the fall to regain some of the ground they ve lost since part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench brazile said democratic congressional committee chairman ben ray lujã n n m said in an interview that the president will help in unifying the democratic base he s going to help boost turnout in november which is critical when you re winning races on the margins lujã n said "

state to show your support your enthusiasm energy your commitment and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on election day so we ve taken the state strategy that howard dean pioneered when he was chair of the national party and we ve gone even further providing more funding more infrastructure more rocket fuel to keep the engines of our state parties firing on all cylinders and holding republicans in office and in elections accountable that means that here in alaska the dnc helps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on election day we fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships in fact kay brown can tell you she was one of the first state party partnership employees we ever hired since the dnc has directly provided the alaska democratic party more than in direct support but it s not just the funding the dnc has been out pacing the gop in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training and bench building we share our deep research and communications capabilities in alaska and across the country since we have quintupled the size of our digital team to boost fundraising and provide training and support to our state parties we ve organized a team of experts in messaging branding and polling to review the way we communicate and we ve built an in house communications team to hold republicans accountable every single day we ve built out a state of the art media monitoring operation to track and inform our rapid response operation our teams are providing training disseminating best practices sharing technology and design assets and building community among state party staff and the rest of the democratic family and combined with our national state of the art voter file which we ve been building out for years we have a real edge that s going to help carry us to victory and we ve done it all while paying off more than million in debt after winning the presidential election and re electing barack obama but of course our number one advantage comes from our candidates and the contrast they re offering alaska voters and the american people i couldn t be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket from day one bernie sanders and hillary clinton have been running smart substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter we ve watched them engage honestly with voters answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the american people and no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward election day in the words of barack obama hillary clinton and bernie sanders trump will not be president at the dnc we are not going to make the same mistake his republican opponents made we re ready for trump ready to hold him accountable for the damage he s doing as a candidate and the damage he s promising he would do as president just this week trump met with paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to show that despite their nasty mud slinging primary they re getting ready to sing kumbaya and give us everything they ve got and what they ve got is the same old playbook the same failed trickle down economic policies that preceded the great recession under the last republican president so trump isn t something new he s just the old republican brand but with a little extra bronzer on he s that much move dangerous he only looks out for himself he lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief and every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world even as a candidate trump has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would make america less safe he has no foreign policy experience but don t worry about that he said he ll rely on his good brain instead of listening to experts he has a decades long record of denigrating women which is why seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy he exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric he s making our communities less safe and he s only a candidate and while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success his record is riddled with examples that he prefers to turn a quick buck even when it comes at the expense of workers but much of this the same old playbook gave george w bush two terms so we have to treat trump s candidacy as a real threat because it is i m inspired here tonight i wish everyone could see how much dedication the

presumptive republican nomineetop evangelical and social conservative leaders are planning a private meeting with donald trump to see if they will be able to address longstanding concern about his candidacy former presidential candidate ben carson is working with tony perkins president of the family research council and bill dallas who leads united in purpose to plan a closed door session for about social conservative leaders to meet with trump in the coming weeks in new york city a broader steering group of about people includes people like american values president gary bauer focus on the family founder james dobson and family leader president bob vander plaats â we are looking for a way forward â perkins says â the main thing here is this is to have a conversation â he described the planned meeting as â a starting point for many â the trump campaign has not publicly confirmed that the meeting will take place for many of the expected attendees at the event trump was not their first choice as a presidential candidates with the exception of carson who has endorsed trump the event organizers were not supportive of trump in the primary says perkins who supported sen ted cruz the event is expected to be a closed door interactive forum for attendees to ask questions of the candidate likely in an interview format not prepared speeches this event is also not intended to focus on rolling out endorsements â i donâ t even know what it will lead to â perkins says â it is just to have an honest conversation so that these leaders know what they need to do â trump campaign surrogates are separately organizing a more official faith advisory committee for the candidate with mike huckabee being discussed as a possible national chairman televangelist paula white a trump supporter and a senior pastor of new destiny christian center in florida have been organizing the group behind the scenes with tim clinton president of the member american association of christian counselors according to several people familiar with the project trumpâ s team meanwhile announced wednesday that he would send a video message to a conference of latino evangelical leaders this weekend in anaheim organized by samuel rodriguez jr the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference hillary clinton is also sending a video message all of these moves signal an attempt to unite a social conservative base that has been deeply fractured over the presumptive gop nominee both the campaign and the constituents groups are testing whether trump can win their support despite division in the primaryâ especially over trumpâ s public refusal to ask for forgiveness his past support for abortion and his harsh rhetoric about women and non whites all things that have left leaders of many large coalitions in the lurch the day after trump became the presumptive nominee for example the lay catholic organization catholic voteâ one of united in purposeâ s partnersâ called trump too â problematic in too many waysâ to receive their endorsement citing concerns over his moral judgment his past support for abortion and his lack of â foundational principles from which he proposes to govern â the group said it would â not necessarilyâ work actively to defeat trump but would turn its resources to critical senate and house seats that is an issue carson hopes to address with social conservatives â donald trump is pro life â carson says of these types of concerns â now he might not be quite as pro life as i am but he definitely believes in the sanctity of life does not believe in abortion on demand that is a misconception that people have â carson is facilitating the gathering as the chairman of myfaithvotes a nonpartisan effort to mobilize million christian voters this election cycle invitations to the meeting are being organized by perkins the founder of the myfaithvotes initiative sealy yates and dallas of united in purpose a c that helps conservative groups change american culture toward judeo christian principles united in purpose has previously worked closely with perkins and has several dozen partners including groups like americans united for life concerned women for america catholic vote and the faith and freedom coalition the ideal event says carson would be â very similar to what happened a couple of weeks ago with mr trump and people on capitol hill getting an opportunity really to sit down face to face and interact with each other and that allays a lot of anxiety on both sides â ronnie floyd president of the southern baptist convention says perkins has invited him to the meeting the purpose is to have a conversation with trump says floyd â to get to know him and for him to get to know usâ who we are and what we care about â for floyd that includes trumpâ s positions on supreme court nominations abortion and racial justice and religious liberty until now trump has largely skirted the traditional evangelical political apparatus in washington instead relying on unusual surrogates like televangelists to support his message among evangelicals whereas jeb bush approached floyd the southern baptist president to meet last august and cruz visited floydâ s church and met with him after the service neither trump nor his campaign has not reached out to floyd â as president of the southern baptist convention i feel like if they had done their homework in relationship to evangelical leaders sooner or later that i might receive a call from them but i have not received that yet â floyd says of trumpâ s team several other social conservative leaders interviewed by time said they are just in the beginning stages of reaching out to the trump campaign penny nance president of the concerned women for america says a campaign surrogate reached out in january to offer a group meeting with trump when nance said she would only go if it were a substantive policy conversation she said they were no longer interested and they did not accept her offer for her to gather a team to really brief him on pro life issues cwa has half a million members a cohort of republican women with a reliable ground operation â this is my fear i work to get my members to first to go vote and i urge everyone to do the things that we do to get our favorite candidates to get elected and all the hours and effort and money that people pour into these candidates and then you wake up the next morning and realize it was all a ruse â nance says â i did everything i could do to blow up the tracks in front of the trump train and it didnâ t work and so at this point you either jump on or stand on the sidelines and wave â tom mcclusky vice president of march for life action says â thereâ s a lot of concernâ in the pro life movement now that trump is the likely gop nominee in late april trump said he would add new exceptions to the republican platform on abortion for rape incest and life of the mother raising big red flags for pro life leaders lila rose president of the prolife educational nonprofit live action called on him to not â diluteâ the platform their fear with trump is more than about just abortion â our theme for the march this year is that pro life and pro women go hand in hand â mcclusky says â some of his statements have been to put it mildly misogynist â chad connelly rncâ s first ever director of faith engagement says he has not yet talked with trump and has had only limited interaction with trumpâ s team he is working a turnout operation on his own a heavy lift given the presumptive nomineeâ s lack of evangelical strategy thus far connelly has so far visited states and has hired some part time pastors that help in some states focusing in florida and ohio â i think our segment is the key this fall â he says â it is the key â others like ralph reed leader of the faith amp freedom coalition and a former senior advisor for the bush cheney campaigns are getting behind the presumptive nominee reed was neutral in the primaries and now tells time that he will personally support trump and do everything he can in his personal capacity to help trumpâ s campaign in the general reed is planning for to be the largest voter education program of his career his team will make million voter contacts directed at million faith based voters primarily in battleground states like iowa florida north carolina virginia colorado and ohio his voter education program budget is projected for million and will include one million door knocks million pieces of mail and on average digital messaging impressions per voter operations like this are often the lifeblood for a successful voter outreachâ in reedâ s second videos earned an completion watch rate â evangelicals donâ t necessarily vote for the candidate who is most like them in terms of religious identity that is just a myth â reed says â if you understand they are issue driven and it is a broad swath of issues on with they vote if you understand that they are not driven primarily by appeals to religious identity then you understand why trump did so well in the primaries and why he has the opportunity to over perform again in the general â david lane of the american renewal project is planning a prayer rally in cleveland the weekend before the republican convention begins â iâ m going to choose to believe that donald trump can be one of the top presidents in american history â he recently wrote to his followers â we intend evangelical and pro life catholic christians to bring biblical based values to the public square bucking up a trump administration willing to confront totalitarian â political correctness â â republican turnout for the first primaries was highest since at least according to the pew research center and about half of that has likely been evangelical voters trump won a plurality of evangelical voters in the republican primaries with cruz finishing a strong

unfortunately for dws we need to submit a word doc can you send the edits back in the document thank you sent via the samsung galaxy sâ an at amp t g lte smartphone original message date pm gmt some eds below also added polling at the bottom talking pointstopline message this week donald trump is essentially becoming the presumptive nominee for the republican party and despite what his new handler paul manafort says itâ s not just a â partâ dangerous donald has â been playing â trump is campaigning on the same ugly and divisive politics that republican leaders have embraced for years and any of their candidates would be dangerous and damaging to our nation weâ re confident weâ ll have a much stronger candidate not only because voters agree that our primary is energizing the party but because our candidates are serious substantive and their values are in line with where the american people are today well into the st century the choice is clear we can move america forward with democrats build on years of progress that took us from the republican recession to the economy we have today and its over million new jobs we can continue to move toward becoming a more inclusive dynamic and competitive country or we can get dragged backwards by republicans who would undo every bit of progress our country has made we like our odds but weâ re not going to take anything for granted weâ re going to work hard weâ re going to ask the american people for their vote and a democrat is going to win in november key message our primary and caucus contests have undoubtedly strengthened our party in new york on tuesday exit polls showed that nearly out of every democrats believe that this campaign has energized the party thatâ s consistent with what we saw in wisconsin where out of democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our candidates thatâ s something weâ re not seeing on the republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues not to mention their temperament given how ugly divisive and insulting theyâ ve been their own voters know it just of republicans in new york think that their campaign has energized their party in wisconsin out of republican primary votersâ let me say that againâ republican primary voters said they fear what a trump presidency would do to our country and roughly a third would rather stay home vote for a third party or vote for a democrat than support either trump or cruz thatâ s stunning but it tells you that democrats are heading into november in a far stronger position than republicans whichever side youâ re on itâ s clear that our two candidates have consistently offered strong well thought out visions for our country that would move america forward we just marked days until our conventions and iâ m more confident than ever weâ ll be united and strong heading out of ours while republicans continue to struggle to defend a bankrupt ideology and divisive campaigns that arenâ t worthy of the american people down the stretch in any campaign you expect the candidates and their supporters to step it up to lay it all on the line and weâ re certainly seeing that on the democratic side but democrats can be proud of our candidates who even through fierce campaigning have had an incredibly substantive debate about the future of our country our candidates are well prepared and theyâ re not afraid to take tough questions voters want to see that the men and women running to serve as their president have the energy the enthusiasm the fire in the belly both of our democratic candidates proved theyâ ve got that fire and that they are ready to fight on behalf of the american people even republicans are abandoning the republican party youâ ve already seen republican candidates in tight races like senator kirk in illinois and john mccain â the gop nominee eight years ago â say they will not attend their own convention in cleveland but donâ t let them fool you theyâ re not any better than the top of their ticket gop frontrunner trump does not have the temperament to be commander in chief donald trumpâ s new chief advisor paul manafort said that trumpâ s outrageous behavior on the campaign trail is simply a â part heâ s been playingâ and that trump is â evolvingâ to become more presidential really the candidate we have been watching on the campaign trail over the past year is the same donald trump that will occupy the oval office if we donâ t stand up now he will govern with the same inappropriate xenophobic and divisive behavior because that is who donald trump is but thereâ s a bigger issue here donald trump is the republican party he may have been more direct and outrageous in how he campaigned over the past few months but make no mistake that the ugly and dangerous rhetoric and policies heâ s pitching are what the republican party has been driving for years he called for punishing women who have abortions in the same week ted cruz and john kasich reiteratedthey he opposes the right of a woman to a safe and legal abortion even in the cases of rape and incest and trump reiterated this week he wouldnâ t make an exception for the health of a woman they all deny climate change they all have economic plans focused on tax cuts for the wealthy that would drag our economy backwards and they all embrace the same divisive and offensive positions on immigrants and wanting to deport dreamers but this week trump came out in support of the lgbt community on the north carolina bathroom bill speaking out against hb and saying it should be left to the states will trump be able to win over moderates with what manafort is promising will be a new tone in the general election thereâ s a bigger issue here trump may have been more direct and outrageous in how he campaigned over the past few months but make no mistake that the ugly and dangerous rhetoric and is what the republican party has been driving for years republicans canâ t separate themselves from trump and he wonâ t be able to separate himself from the ugly things he his fellow candidates and the leadership of the republican party have said for years if donald trump becomes president if republicans take over the white house they will drag america backwards on everything from lgbt rights to the economic progress weâ ve made under president obama taking a new tone for the general election canâ t erase the damage trump himself has done with his ugly rhetoric and it wonâ t make up for what republicans have done when in office and what theyâ re promising to do if they win dangerous donald lacks the temperament and judgment to be president on abortion last week trump took multiple positions on abortion from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion to saying he would allow states to restrict womenâ s rights to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments joint fundraising committees we welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the dnc and state parties similar agreements were set up with both the clinton campaign and the sanders campaign early in the cycle precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect democrats up and down the ballot in november the sanders campaign has not used theirs itâ s important to note the funds that the dnc and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen for example our national voter file and communications research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates that includes training across a variety of areas for example and access to media monitoring and rapid response support this is helping us build infrastructure for the general election these arrangements are not new or unusual similar joint fundraising committees were established with our democratic candidate in both and and again both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds and letâ s be clear neither the dnc nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign for whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising contested convention arizona lawsuit it is way too early to discuss the questions of a contested convention there are nearly twenty contests still to play out including tonightâ s primary in new york secretary clinton and senator sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another but their differences remain focused on how to best move america forward theyâ re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the american people that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive and that we respect everyone in america and last thursday we our ninth debate saw showed that they both see the bigger picture the democratic national committee and our senatorial campaign committee are suing officials in arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their march primaries and many to be disenfranchised as a result if you want to talk about rigging elections thatâ s the real example and itâ s a serious problem and weâ re glad both our candidates are interested in supporting that in maricopa county officials reduced the number of polling locations to just for every people thatâ s seven eight times what it was in other parts of the state and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that republicans are championing all across the country and itâ s not just arizona you had a member of congress from wisconsin glenn grothman who flat out said that they expected they could now win wisconsin because of the voter id law it was his kevin mccarthy moment and the type of rigging of the system weâ re not going to put up with when voters go to the polls in november they can be certain that the democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief and that s not something you can say about the republican candidates clintonâ s speeches and sandersâ taxes our job at the party isnâ t to handicap our own primary weâ re not going to referee there are real differences but theyâ re with the republicans and while you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differences theyâ re also highlighting what a much better option voters have with democrats just look at the issue of taxes as millions of americans filed last week yesterday but most of them didnâ t get to take advantage of special loopholes or get special breaks yet every single republican plan for the economy is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale itâ s exactly the economic policy that the bush administration had as they drove us toward the great recession so ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in november cruz the vast majority of his republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him lindsey graham crassly talked about how no one in the senate would object if he was killed on the senate floor and said that endorsing him over trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot senator jim risch of idaho â twice â gave one of the most passive non endorsement endorsements iâ ve ever seen itâ s going to be very difficult for senators and congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really donâ t like and if these guys are reluctant to show their support for a senate colleague i am not sure how the american people will be able to back cruz either the gopâ s problem with women voterstrump is viewed unfavorably by out of women but both of his primary opponents showed this week that they would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term in the past the republican candidates have opposed ensuring equal pay family leave and voted against the violence against women act this past tuesday was equal pay day was a couple week ago the day in when womenâ s earnings have caught up with menâ s earnings from on average we earn cents to their dollar and itâ s worse for women of color all of the republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace john kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we donâ t need workplace protections just a â change of heartâ among major employers ted cruz voted against the paycheck fairness act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a â show vote â donald trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did â as good a jobâ as men republicans to blame for trump and his down ballot impactitâ s fitting that donald trump is the standard bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long since theyâ ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security theyâ ve given birthers like trump a pass and fueled the tea party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy then while in office the only thing republicans have done in washington over the last seven years is obstruct trump is the republican party advantage democratsdespite all the media attention that republican frontrunner trump gets with his say anything strategy democrats are winning where it matters secretary clinton has earned over million vote million votes â a full million more than trump â while senator sanders has seven almost million votes well ahead of kasich and cruz and has garnered more than seven million individual campaign contributions overalldemocrats will have the strongest candidate in november period and we are poised to take back the senate and make serious gains in the house broad contrast and infrastructurewe have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the republicans nominate we see the numbers of course itâ s clear trump is far ahead of his competitors and weâ re ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention but we donâ t think taking on trump is fundamentally different from any of the others at least with trump heâ s not shy about exposing what the republican brand has truly become ted cruz and john kasich are every bit as extreme as their partyâ s front runner they just hide it a bit better they promise the same extreme agenda on womenâ s rights they deny the threat of climate change and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship they all want to drag america back to the failed economic policies of the last republican president who left office losing jobs a month and having plunged our country into the great recession and theyâ ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric using language that alienates our allies helps isis recruit terrorists and makes america less safe so if it is trump weâ re ready maybe itâ s cruz but itâ s hard to see how that comes together in the end but regardless weâ re building a ground game and an infrastructure thatâ s ready to challenge him on every single position heâ s taking on the campaign trail and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the american people polling clinton v trump clinton clinton v cruz clinton clinton v kasich kasich sanders v trump sanders

"2016-05-12 11:38","Bernie Sanders, the Zombie Candidate - POLITICO Magazine","paul.hamill@loganir.com","mirandal@dnc.org"," just in case you missed this from david bernie sanders the zombie candidatedavid wadewhen he first decided to run for president bernie sanders had a goal in mind to start a political revolution by getting big money out of politics if he wants to do itâ if sanders wants to build a lasting movement to fight moneyâ s outsize influenceâ he has to close one door to open another the transition from contender to gracious supporter of the nominee isnâ t easy for any presidential candidate but he needs to make it and soon story continued belowwe already know sanders isnâ t going to win the democratic partyâ s nomination hillary clinton has amassed more than percentof the delegates needed to secure the nomination and sheâ ll easily pick up the rest so right now sandersâ campaign is the walking dead a zombie and having worked for john kerry during the slugfest of the primaries iâ ve seen up close how much damage this sort of prolonged zombie candidacy can inflict on the eventual nomineeâ and whatâ s ultimately at stake for the country itâ s an article of faith in politics that competitive primaries create stronger nominees and i witnessed this firsthand as well kerry grew immensely as a candidate in the course of being tested by rivals from dick gephardt to howard dean ditto for barack obama in healthy competition is a good thing but continuing to contest a primary after your path to victory disappears is not healthy it actively hinders your would be partisan ally before spring began in it was clear that the process had produced a nominee but deep into primary season after a winning streak that knocked out most of our opponents the campaigns of dean wesley clark and john edwards lingered on even as they were on life support their organizations took needlessly hard shots at kerry at the same time republicans were inundating the presumptive democratic nominee with a daily barrage of attacks by february statewide caucuses and primaries had completed and edwards had carried only his birth state south carolina that evening edwards used a debate in wisconsin to hammer kerry on trade and spending when kerry who had won of the first contests started to talk about taking on president george w bush in the general election edwards pounced â not so fast john kerry â he said â we got a whole group of primaries coming up and i for one intend to fight â just north of one week later bush gleefully made his first public speech attacking kerry and kicked off the general election with biting television adsâ all while our campaign was hunkered down fighting in super tuesday states that we knew wouldnâ t be competitive in the general election on super tuesday we won nine of the statesâ and spent plenty of money to do it but thatâ s what you have to do when doomed primary opponents donâ t accept reality all the while the bush campaign publicized the democratic attacks on kerry they were overjoyed to receive a liberal version of in kind contributions to the republican national committee in continued competition after the match was essentially over didnâ t improve our campaign or candidate it hurt the democratic party kerry wouldâ ve benefited from a decent interval to recharge his batteries reset for the fall and focus the campaign entirely on the republican attack machine today with donald trump all but guaranteed to be the republican nominee the general election electorate is beginning to tune in at a time when voters could be comparing trump and secretary clinton the presumptive nominees theyâ re instead seeing clinton take shrapnel not just from the republicans but from sanders sanders has a stake in this i hope he sees it sanders needs to think long and hard about the big cost of criticizing the now prohibitive democratic front runner he didnâ t set out to become trumpâ s best ghostwriter for the general election but that is the role continued attacks on clinton risk earning him make no mistake clinton is a crisper candidate than she was a year ago a credit to her sparring partner from vermont she has upped her game but at this point it would be better for the democratic party if clinton could focus on the asymmetric political warfare to come from trumpâ which she could do right now if she didnâ t have to maintain a second front battling a pesky primary opponent who cannot win without math or momentum on his side isnâ t it better for sanders to finish the campaign as a happy warrior and build a long term movement for campaign finance reform or would he rather be remembered for damaging the democratic standard bearer when we have to crush trump and win back the senate in november the best path for sanders is also the best path for his newly adopted political party sanders has already changed the political conversation in whether wage inequality middle class pain or the distorting role of money in politics he has made a mark but if the last wheezes of sandersâ efforts echo those of jerry brownâ s campaign in â i e attacking a clinton personally instead of advocating core issues with a positive agendaâ the issues that sanders cares about will suffer whatâ s the alternative for sanders if he is serious about creating lasting political changeâ and i believe he isâ he should start a national movement to drive money out of politics sanders could harness his enormous grass roots fundraising network and the cash it has stockpiledâ and can replenish repeatedlyâ to elect candidates from the white house to the congress to the state and local levels who are committed to repealing citizens united he could target senate republicans in states like new hampshire wisconsin and pennsylvania inspiring voters there to â feel the bernâ and defeat the incumbents he could hold those new senators accountable and enlist them in his quest to rid big money from the political system he could help hillary clinton win big and sweep in a democratic majority in the senate he could become a powerful committee chairman he could return to the next senate as one of its most influential players and for an independent socialist from vermont who started this campaign as an asterisk thatâ s a political revolution in itself david wade was a senior communications

executive committee all our community leaders and members of the host committee for your tireless work and commitment to our party i know you lead busy lives but we can t pull off a successful convention without you let me also thank our ceo the unparalleled reverend leah daughtry for her tireless work we are so fortunate to have a lifelong democrat of leah s passion and expertise steering the ship and of course i need to thank the honorable mayor jim kenney as well as all the wonderful people of philadelphia who he represents we are enormously grateful that you re hosting and warmly welcoming all the democrats bringing their enthusiasm energy and passion as we arrive in greater and greater numbers over the next few months and i know mayor kenney appreciates all the commerce we ll be bringing with us as conference goers visit philly s great restaurants hotels and small businesses gearing upwe re just days away from our convention and we ve been making all the right moves to ensure we ll be one hundred percent prepared at kickoff time we are on time on budget and ready to run a beautiful convention but as proud as i am of what we re doing i have to mention how proud i am of who is doing it each day as our numbers grow we re making sure that our diversity does too as democrats we believe our diversity is our great strength that shows in the ranks of the dnc where last year thirty six percent of our employees were people of color and we ve awarded at least percent of our contracts to companies owned by women veterans minorities people with disabilities and members of the lgbt community and when the nation looks at our convention they ll see a portrait of america our party affairs and delegate selection team has worked tirelessly to ensure that every state party has an accessible and inclusive process for anyone to run to become a delegate whether it s a school teacher in orlando a plumber in cleveland or a high school student in denver our convention delegates will reflect the diversity our party dangerous donaldbut before anyone casts a vote to nominate the next democratic president of the united states let me give you a little update from the dnc today and every day until election day we are laser focused on take down holding dangerous donald trump accountable and winning seats up and down the ballot in every race across the country with every other candidate out of the race trump is the republican party we are not going to let anyone forget hold him accountable for everything he has said and everything he has done and we are going to hold the gop accountable for everything they re doing to obstruct divide and drag our country backwards the facts are simple dangerous donald is unfit to be president he only looks out for himself he lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief and every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world even as a candidate dangerous donald has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would undeniably make america less safe he has no foreign policy experience but don t worry about that he said he ll rely on his good brain instead of listening to experts dangerous he has a decades long record of denigrating women seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy he exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media and recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric he s making our communities less safe and he hasn t even gotten into office and while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success his record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes that are designed to turn a quick a buck at the expense of his workers or everyday americans i ll spare you all the details but trust me that s the short version of what the american people are going to be hearing about dangerous donald over the coming months you know there s a reason why we saw republicans across the country this week tweeting photos of their burning voter registration cards this week advantage democratswell we have a message for anyone disillusioned and disaffected by this year s unprecedentedly nasty and divisive republican primary we have a message for anyone disgusted by donald you have a home in the democratic party we have the best candidates the best ideas and a fantastic record of social and economic progress under president obama to run on consecutive months of private sector job growth and million americans who have health insurance who didn t before in poll after poll democratic voters are reporting that our primary and our candidates have energized our party in nevada voter registration among democrats is beating republicans two to one so no matter what challenges lie ahead in the planning and execution of our convention let me just say clearly and unequivocally i am really really glad we are not planning the republican convention and i am absolutely optimistic about the future of the democratic party conclusionfinally i ll just say this convention is about so much more than the spectacle of big political speeches under red white and blue balloons and confetti although i think we might have some of that in store this is about the direction of our nation this is about the power of the people to come together and choose the best leader for the job and no matter which of our candidates they choose they ll be fighting every day for all americans we re fighting to level the playing field raise wages ensure equal pay end discrimination expand voting rights make our country and our communities more secure and fighting to give hardworking americans everywhere a fair shot when it comes time to nominate our choices for president and vice president with your help we will unify fight together as

bssent via the samsung galaxy sâ an at amp t g lte smartphone original message date pm gmt talking pointstopline message yesterday americans in five states went to the polls with democrats voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most â and republicans holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike least â in pennsylvania exit polling showed that percent of democratic voters felt their primary had energized the party while percent of republican voters said their primary had divided the party thatâ s what we saw in new york where just of republicans thought their campaign has energized their party while in wisconsin out of republican primary voters said they fear what a trump presidency would do to our country and roughly a third would rather stay home vote for a third party or vote for a democrat than support either trump or cruz â thatâ s stunning but it tells you that democrats are heading into november in a far stronger position than republicans for years gop leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants minorities the poor the lgbt community and more all for political gain they have sold hardworking americans the empty promise of trickle down prosperity while strangling americaâ s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top donald trumpâ s impending nomination after tuesdayâ s results is the ultimate sad culmination of the success of that strategy trump is the modern republican party itâ s clear that when we get through our conventions democrats will emerge united having nominated the next president while the gop will have to wallow in the chaotic mess of their own making trump promises to be trump cruz and kasich prove gop broken governmentâ itâ s hard to pick whatâ s been a stranger story the past week trump empowering his new advisor to calm the rnc by saying he would change his ways but then changing his mind or ted cruz and john kasich devising a pact and having it fall apart almost right away â when donald trump said in his remarks last night that heâ s not â playing a partâ and that heâ s â not changing â that his â thought process is the same â believe him â heâ ll continue to be the divisive offensive republican candidate who lacks the judgment and temperament to lead â and when cruz and kasich proved they canâ t even coordinate with each other well itâ s a reminder that the republican vision of smaller government is broken government hardly surprising given that ted cruzâ s biggest accomplishment was shutting down the government and costing the economy billion chaos in cleveland vs our next president in philadelphiaweâ re less than days from the july conventions and itâ s clear that democrats will emerge united while republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency both hillary clinton and bernie sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual democratic nominee â just yesterday senator sanders said at a town hall on msnbc that he will do everything in his power to make sure no republican gets into the white house in november â and secretary clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress weâ ve made under democratic leadership over the last years â because the partyâ s platform is a statement of our values the dnc is committed to an open inclusive and representative process both of our campaigns will be represented on the platform drafting committee and just as we did in and the public will have opportunities to participate democrats know that weâ re stronger when more voices are heard and when we stand together to move our country forward weâ ll see that in philadelphia at our convention compare that to the republicans â this week the increasingly desperate cruz and kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop trump but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was happening â a majority of trump supporters said they would abandon the republican party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third party candidate â even republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive convention youâ ve already seen republican candidates in tight races like senator kirk in illinois and john mccain â the gop nominee eight years ago â say they will not attend their own convention in cleveland but donâ t let them fool you theyâ re not any better than the top of their ticket joint fundraising committeesâ we welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the dnc and state parties which is why stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the clinton campaign and the sanders campaign early in the cycle â the dnc is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect democrats up and down the ballot in november â itâ s important to note the funds that the dnc and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen for example our national voter file and communications research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates that includes training across a variety of areas for example and access to media monitoring and rapid response support this is helping us build infrastructure for the general election â these arrangements are not new or unusual similar joint fundraising committees were established with our democratic candidate in both and and again both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds â and letâ s be clear neither the dnc nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign for whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising contested convention arizona lawsuitâ weâ re going to be united at our convention and weâ re confident in our process which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates â weâ ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise â ultimately secretary clinton and senator sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another but their differences remain focused on how to best move america forward â theyâ re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the american people that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive and that we respect everyone in america â if you want to talk about a rigged process weâ re doing that too the democratic national committee and our senatorial campaign committee are suing officials in arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their march primaries and many to be disenfranchised as a result we want to make sure that doesnâ t happen in november â if you want to talk about rigging elections thatâ s the real example and itâ s a serious problem and weâ re glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the american people to vote â in maricopa county officials reduced the number of polling locations to just for every people thatâ s seven times what it was in other parts of the state and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that republicans are championing all across the country â and itâ s not just arizona you had a member of congress from wisconsin glenn grothman who flat out said that they expected they could now win wisconsin because of the voter id law it was his kevin mccarthy moment and the type of rigging of the system weâ re not going to put up with â when voters go to the polls in november they can be certain that the democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief and that s not something you can say about the republican candidates clintonâ s speeches and sandersâ taxesâ our job at the party isnâ t to handicap our own primary weâ re not going to referee â there are real differences but theyâ re with the republicans and while you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differences theyâ re also highlighting what a much better option voters have with democrats â just look at the issue of taxes as millions of americans filed last week but most of them didnâ t get to take advantage of special loopholes or get special breaks yet every single republican plan for the economy is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale itâ s exactly the economic policy that the bush administration had as they drove us toward the great recession â so ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in november gop frontrunner trump is reckless and dangerousâ on abortion trump has taken multiple positions on abortion from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion to saying he would allow states to restrict womenâ s rights to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments cruzâ the vast majority of his republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him â lindsey graham crassly talked about how no one in the senate would object if he was killed on the senate floor and said that endorsing him over trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot â senator jim risch of idaho â twice â gave one of the most passive non endorsement endorsements iâ ve ever seen â itâ s going to be very difficult for senators and congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really donâ t like the gopâ s problem with women voterstrump is viewed unfavorably by out of women but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee â cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term â in the past the republican candidates have opposed equal pay family leave and voted against the violence against women act earlier this month we marked equal pay day the day in when womenâ s earnings have caught up with menâ s earnings from on average we earn cents to their dollar and itâ s worse for women of color all of the republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace â john kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we donâ t need workplace protections just a â change of heartâ among major employers â ted cruz voted against the paycheck fairness act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a â show vote â â donald trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did â as good a jobâ as men republicans to blame for trump and his down ballot impactitâ s fitting that donald trump is the standard bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long since theyâ ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security theyâ ve given birthers like trump a pass and fueled the tea party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy then while in office the only thing republicans have done in washington over the last seven years is obstruct trump is the republican party advantage democratsdespite all the media attention that republican frontrunner trump gets with his say anything strategy democrats are winning where it matters â senator clinton has earned more than million votes â over a million more than donald trump â while senator sanders has earned more than million votes well ahead of ted cruz and john kasich while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors if there is an enthusiasm gap it clearly favors democrats â democrats will have the strongest candidate in november period and we are poised to take back the senate and make serious gains in the house broad contrast and infrastructureâ we have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the republicans nominate we see the numbers of course itâ s clear trump is far ahead of his competitors and weâ re ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention â but we donâ t think taking on trump is fundamentally different from any of the others â at least with trump heâ s not shy about exposing what the republican brand has truly become ted cruz and john kasich are every bit as extreme as their partyâ s front runner they just hide it a bit better â they promise the same extreme agenda on womenâ s rights they deny the threat of climate change and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship â they all want to drag america back to the failed economic policies of the last republican president who left office losing jobs a month and having plunged our country into the great recession â and theyâ ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric using language that alienates our allies helps isis recruit terrorists and makes america less safe â so if it is trump weâ re ready maybe itâ s cruz but itâ s hard to see how that comes together in the end but regardless weâ re building a ground game and an infrastructure thatâ s ready to challenge him on every single position heâ s taking on the campaign trail and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the american people "

colleagues as part of a corrupt washington cartel in kentucky senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was selected over the weekend as a delegate to the convention in cleveland this summer trump supporter sen jeff sessions of alabama is a delegate as well and in north carolina a member of the house gop leadership rep patrick mchenry is expected to be a delegate as is sen thom tillis in interviews with cnn a wide range of lawmakers refused to say how they d vote once most delegates are free to vote their conscience after a first round of balloting depending on how some decisions are going to be made i could be part of helping the delegates as a whole make that decision of selecting the nominee tillis said i m legitimately uncommitted the gop lawmakers presence adds a new wrinkle to the prospects of an open convention in july while many congressional republicans are planning on skipping what could be an unruly convention to worry about their own reelection campaigns others are poised to play an outsized role if no candidate can secure the delegates to clinch the nomination before july while cruz has succeeded by courting an array of delegates who back his candidacy many are simply undecided about how they d vote in a contested convention including influential members of congress mcconnell for one could hold sway with many of his state s delegates the gop leader who has been a frequent cruz punching bag has been stressing electability over ideology that the party should nominate a candidate who could defeat the democratic nominee likely hillary clinton that mirrors an argument that ohio gov john kasich in particular has been making as he tries to appeal to delegates it could be a really interesting convention mcconnell told kentucky republicans attending their state party s convention in lexington on saturday one thing i want to assure you is there isn t any sort of insider effort that could go on to keep this from being anything other than a pretty open transparent process the delegation includes gov matt bevin sen rand paul and house members including rep andy barr an ally of mcconnell s he s uncommitted barr spokesman rick vanmeter said when asked how his boss would vote after a first ballot what could give lawmakers some cover from angry constituents is the likelihood that their individual votes could be shielded from public scrutiny while each state will publicly announce how many votes it will cast for each candidate it may not be clear how individual delegates vote and that includes many lawmakers i m always amused by the suggestions that there is some kind of group that can deliver the nomination mcconnell said let me say if there were such a group i probably would be in it right there isn t any such group what happens to rubio delegates a big question remains what will happen to the pledged delegates held by former gop presidential candidate marco rubio once they become unbound cruz has claimed a number of them will back him on a second ballot and beyond but rubio could have a huge influence if he urges his delegates to vote a certain way in a brief interview last week the florida senator told cnn i haven t had those conversations about whom his delegates should back rubio has not endorsed any of the candidates since dropping out of the race last month asked if he d seek his party s nomination if the convention remained deadlocked rubio was coy i ve spent no time thinking about that i m now focused on the senate he said states vary in how they handle candidates no longer in the race in oklahoma delegates are bound by the results of the state which cruz carried with percent of the vote giving a boost to the texas republican and potentially trump who claimed second place with percent yet party rules free oklahoma delegates once a candidate s name no longer appears on the ballot for nomination at the convention something that could impact delegates for rubio who won delegates by his third place showing in the state each state has its own rules for when delegates are allowed vote their conscience in the first round of voting percent of delegates are bound by the results of their states a number that drops to percent in the second round and percent in a third round in some states rules make it harder for delegates to vote freely after the first ballot in alabama where trump won delegates with percent of the vote the state s delegation is bound by the results until two thirds of the delegates agree to release themselves and vote how they want sessions the alabama republican and senate s lone gop trump supporter said he doesn t expect mass defections from his delegation on the convention floor we met with our delegates sessions said himself a delegate i don t expect any of the trump delegates in alabama to alter their support for trump then there are the wild cards oklahoma sen jim inhofe a former rubio supporter who now backs kasich has been sharply critical in the past of cruz s sharply worded comments about fellow senate republicans while he s not a delegate inhofe said he may urge a trump kasich ticket in cleveland he d never say that he d be agreeable to be vice president but that s because that time hasn t come yet inhofe said of kasich cnn s robert yoon contributed to this reportsent from my iphone"

atlantic city casino and his trump university at the end trump repeats the words believe me as the words con man appear on the screen why this mattersclinton s biggest vulnerability to trump right now is the perception that he would be better for jobs and the economy in a cnn orc poll earlier this month clinton led trump by double digits overall but he held a percent to percent lead on the economy hillary clinton doesn t have a deep background in economics and has been until this point leaning on her own platform and bill clinton s record to recommend her as a good steward of the economy if trump can convince the american public that he s a great businessman and could replicate his success in the corporate world for the rest of the country clinton is in trouble she doesn t have to beat

is that all three candidates clinton trump and sanders â have said that long term infrastructure revitalization is a key issue for them and all three understand it s the best way to create millions of

almost every facet of our infrastructure â water and sewer lines pipelines the build out of the electrical grid broadband access dams ports etcetera etcetera is trump vulnerable to attacks on his
