"2016-05-06 12:02","POLITICO Pulse, presented by PhRMA: What's next from CMS: More help for doctors? â€” What's next for e-cig backers","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edtmillennials have killed america s year running boom and critics say that media coverage of a medical error study is error ridden but first the head of cms hints that the agency will roll out new initiatives to support doctors what s next from cms more help for physicians that s what cms acting administrator andy slavitt teased in a fireside chat thursday in baltimore slavitt said that three core principles that cms needs to simplify physicians practice offer more flexibility and pay better for primary care are shaping new rules and programs like the macra law and comprehensive primary care cpc demonstration and those three beliefs will find their way into other things this summer too he hinted they re also the core elements to ensure that small primary care practices remain independent slavitt said on twitter responding to farzad mostashari s assertion on politico s pulse check podcast that medicare is inadvertently pressuring the independent physician model what s next for e cig backers hoping for help from the senate under thursday s rule e cigarette companies must file an application with the fda within two years to prove that they don t present any new public health risks that s expected to prove costly and could thin the industry pro s brett norman points out more on that below vaping companies have allies in the house who have pushed an amendment to exempt e cigarettes already on the market from fda s review but any hopes that the senate may join that effort might be built on fumes the senate has shown little interest to date in interfering with fda oversight of vaping big tobacco is getting just what it wanted that s according to law professor jonathan adler who writes in the washington post s volokh conspiracy blog that the regulation will force many vaping companies out of the market even if smaller manufacturers can satisfy the relevant regulatory deadlines the rules will increase the cost of e cigs limiting their cost advantage vis a vis traditional cigarettes and inhibit continued product innovation adler said arguing it may turn out to be harmful for public health cost of compliancefda tobacco chief mitch zeller estimates the cost of application at several hundred thousand dollars though some e cig advocates said that s a low ball figure and many smaller players couldn t afford it in any case thank goodness it s friday

"2016-04-26 15:43","RE: For approval: Brad deadline emails","LykinsT@dnc.org","ReifE@dnc.org,  EMail-Vetting_D@dnc.org"," greathi all below are four emails to send from brad this week for our monthly deadline he has already signed off let me know if you have any flags thanks eric v ch friend when people support the democratic party they give a lot of reasons why when you gave xx on date to the dnc it might have been because you alt for nds when folks like you give to the dnc it s often because you want to protect the progress that we ve made over the past seven years or it s because you don t want to see million people lose the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care coverage and because you don t want to see declining graduation rates for our young people and you don t want to see the unprecedented job growth we ve experienced over the past months reversed the xx donations you ve made in this election alt for nds the donations grassroots supporters have made in this election prove just how committed you are to moving this country forward and we can t thank you enough for that every single day folks like you are laying the foundation for some critical wins in november in important races all across the country not just the presidential race we re poised to replace governors and senators who are living in the past with democrats whose vision for the future of this country means actually moving this country into the future so right now i m coming to you again because we need you name we need you to dig deep and pitch in again before our monthly deadline saturday at midnight can i count on you to pitch in or whatever you can to make sure our candidates have the resources they need to win linksthanks name we can t win without you bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v ejb democrats have been pretty fortunate this election cycle name we have two terrific presidential candidates in hillary clinton and bernie sanders making us proud with smart substantive debates and focusing on the issues that really matter it s a world of difference from the pettiness and name calling we ve seen on the other side and because republican senators so often refuse to do their jobs we ve got a map that s in our favor and a good chance to take back our majority this is all good news but unfortunately republican in fighting hasn t distracted them from their desire to beat us and i know that because it s my job to look at the numbers and so far the gop has raised more than million to beat us that s a lot of money name and i ll be honest it s more than we ve raised but here s a bit more good news there s still time to build the kind of foundation we need to win in november we just need grassroots supporters like you to step up and help us cross that finish line can i count on you to pitch in or more before this next end of month deadline linksthanks so much with the help of supporters like you i know we re going to knock this one out of the park bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v jgr friend i m going to be very straightforward with you name we haven t raised as much money as our counterparts on the republican side we re coming up short according to their most recent fec reports the rnc has raised million during this election that s a hell of a lot of money and while we might not catch up to their mega donors we have another resource that matters even more you with grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like or bucks we re slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure that democrats all across the country are going to benefit from come november we re laying the foundation for serious wins and we need to keep going every time someone like you decides to click that donate button and give whatever you can it s another voice telling the rnc and the millionaires and billionaires who are backing them that they can t buy this election we ve got the right candidates and we re fighting on the right side of history now we ve just got to see it through til november th so name i m asking you to be one of those voices right now push this button and pitch in or whatever you can to support democrats up and down the ticket all across the country donate buttonthanks a lot bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v er friend last week the republican national committee released their fec fundraising report from march and i won t mince words we got beat and the republicans have now raised more than million in total all to beat us in november that means this month s deadline just got that much more important we need to start making up the difference now if we re going to give our presidential nominee and all our candidates what they need to win in november here s what we have in our online donation records for email lt link gt but frankly no matter what it says i need you to pitch in or more right now lt link gt name nametotal donated for xxmost recent donation xx on mm dd yylinksdonors i can promise you this name we are squeezing every cent out of the total you ve given so far and your next most rec or whatever you re able to give this time will go a long way to helping us close this critical fundraising gap nondonors name there s never been a better moment to take that big step and make your first donation of this election i really mean that whatever you re able to give will go a long way to helping us close this critical fundraising gap this month s deadline is at midnight on saturday i hope i see your donation on the books before then linkthanks so much bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee"

primaries on tuesday night trump went five for five and added at least delegates bringing him to of the he needs clinton went four for five taking pennsylvania maryland delaware and connecticut while bernie sanders won only rhode island clinton now has of the delegates she needs the democratic race is over and has been for a while sanders cannot catch clinton in bound delegates and will not be able to flip super delegates he acknowledged as much in his statement tuesday night pledging to solider on to the convention to have an influence on the party platform rather than competing for the nomination the gop race is close to over as well though trump could still fall short of if he loses indiana to cruz next week and republicans hoping to win in november must have cringed hard at trump s victory remarks tuesday night when he claimed that if clinton were a man she would only get percent of the vote he also said i think the only card she that she has is the women s card she s got nothing else going for her this is of course both wildly sexist and quite insane another clinton who is a man did pretty well in a pair of presidential races plus clinton is a former senator and

trump is losing them by then move on to real challenge non white females trump nears vote record politico s kyle cheney with his five blowout wins tuesday night donald trump has passed mitt romney s popular vote total from four years ago and is on a trajectory that could land him more republican votes than any presidential candidate in modern history by a lot trump surged to million votes that s about votes more than romney earned in the entire primary season and less than john mccain earned in sanders statement the people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the democratic party should be that s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast that is why this campaign is going to the democratic national convention in philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a an hour minimum wage an end to our disastrous trade policies a medicare for all

fed is not in that business what matters to markets then is the language the fed uses to describe the soft looking recent domestic economic data the upturn in inflation and critically policymakers

kentucky where voters will head to the polls on may ticking through his standard stump lines while bashing clinton for her paid speeches and vote in favor of invading iraq sanders told a boisterous crowd that their ideas will prevail i ll tell you what is extremely exciting for me and that is that in primary after primary caucus after caucus we end up winning the vote of people years of age and younger sanders said and that is important because it tells me that ideas that we are fighting for are the ideas for the future of america and the future of the democratic party the wall street

indiana s primary forced his chief rival ted cruz to quit the race trump overcame a spirited last stand by cruz and a patchwork movement of republicans working desperately to derail him in fear that his polarizing politics could doom the party to gallop to the nomination indiana s results positioned him to easily accumulate the delegates required to avert a contested convention the wall street

climax that arrived tuesday donald trump who was something between a curiosity and an after thought at the outset won the indiana primary a victory quickly followed by the withdrawal of his last serious opponent sen ted cruz from the race mr trump now will be the republican nominee for president the most unexpected outcome of a primary contest since jimmy carter emerged from obscurity to win the democratic nomination four decades ago mr trump reached that milestone on a day of striking ugliness when he essentially accused mr cruz s father of cavorting with a presidential assassin and mr

votes continued to be counted cruz had been counting on a win in tuesday s primary to slow the new york businessman s progress toward the nomination but polls in recent days showed trump opening up a

presidential candidate and former u s ambassador to china remarked that trump is better positioned than any other republican candidate to assemble a coalition across party lines three things one i have a tremendous amount of respect for gov huntsman jindal said secondly i think donald trump is going to have the hardest time beating hillary of all the republican candidate that ran for president then again trump would still be the best choice jindal suggested having said that third however if he is the nominee i will be voting for him i will be supporting him he said explaining that there are

contest the republican convention but a string of massive losses in the northeast and his subsequent defeat in indiana convinced his team there was no way forward from the beginning i ve said that i would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory cruz said with his wife heidi by his side tonight i m sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation we are suspending our campaign from the start cruz has premised his candidacy on the idea that would be an election driven by resentment

campaign plans kasich s chief strategist john weaver said in a statement our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention the comments from

s foreign policy have been an overdependence on individual leaders who frequently fail to deliver on american expectations and a reluctance to accept that an established status quo can t hold the obama administration has committed both those errors in iraq and it has done so more than once in its zeal to withdraw all u s troops in time for president obama s reelection campaign in the administration threw its weight behind then prime minister nouri al maliki with disastrous consequences mr maliki s shiite sectarianism fractured the fragile political system and opened the way for the islamic state in having pushed for mr maliki s removal the administration bet on haider al abadi now in its impatience to reduce the islamic state before mr obama leaves office it clings to a prime minister who has proved unable to govern the country or reconcile its warring factions mr abadi s impotence was revealed most dramatically over the weekend when shiite supporters of anti american firebrand moqtada al sadr stormed into baghdad s walled off green zone and invaded the parliament nominally the protesters were supporting one of mr abadi s aims to create a new technocratic cabinet to replace a corrupt system of dividing ministries according to party and sectarian lines but mr abadi denounced the invasion which showed him as unable to control either the political insurgents or the established parties that have repeatedly rejected his reform proposals the new york times editorial boardthe republican party s trek into the darkness took a fateful step in indiana on tuesday the hoosier state delivered an all but crowning victory to donald trump who beat ted cruz soundly in the state sweeping up at least delegates shortly after the race was called mr cruz

clinton though it was not enough to halt her march to the nomination that the never trumpers had hoped to fall back on mr cruz perhaps the most reviled politician in his party was a measure of their panic about the prospect now before them with mr trump s success i m watching a year old political party commit suicide said henry olsen an elections analyst with the ethics and public policy center a republican think tank republicans will all but certainly nominate mr trump who would be the most volatile and least prepared presidential candidate nominated by a major party in modern times a man

enjoys a special kind of justice prosecutors meted out a special kind of justice for jeffrey epstein larded with fawning obsequiousness secret dealings and an astoundingly lenient sentence after all billionaires even billionaire sex abusers aren t like you and me investigators documented that at least underage girls some as young as were repeatedly exploited by epstein and his buddies for their carnal amusement at his palm beach mansion from to according to court documents the girls were required to administer topless or nude massage while mr epstein masturbated himself occasionally the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse state and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of federal and state sex crimes to two state charges soliciting prostitution and procuring a person younger than for prostitution meanwhile the feds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges they granted immunity to his various co conspirators the federal prosecutors who seemed cowed by epstein s high powered attorneys including roy black kenneth starr and alan dershowitz worked out the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser would be spared federal charges the failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal lawsuit filed in west palm beach against the u s attorney s office in by two of the young women identified as jane doe no and jane doe no on wednesday their attorneys filed a page motion demanding a summary judgment in their favor whether or not u s district judge kenneth marra grants the motion the document along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic emails and letters from prosecutors to epstein s legal team sure as hell prove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the u s justice system the correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet plea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of it one exchange suggested that he plead guilty in miami which would hopefully cut the press coverage significantly no wonder epstein received a piddling month sentence for a crime that got less exalted sex offenders in florida or years hard time his less than hard time amounted to months in the palm beach county stockade except he was allowed to spend hours a day six days a week at his nicely appointed office as part of a work release program he then served the balance of his sentence under house arrest quite an imposition for someone with a luxury mansion on the barrier island consider that this occurred at a time when low rent sex offenders were forced to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath miami s julia tuttle causeway without water toilets electricity of course super rich epstein managed to avoid such indignities nowadays the convict is occasionally featured in tabloid photos snapped as he flits about new york in the company of young beautiful women justice the special justice for billionaires has been served the miami herald feb justin bieber hires high powered lawyer roy black in dui case justin bieber is bringing in the big guns in a bid to beat his dui charge the singer who

people jan jeffrey epstein attorney roy black denies allegations in letter by ex u s attorney alexander acosta attorney roy black is disputing claims that he and other attorneys representing jeffrey epstein pried into federal prosecutors personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender black also denies epstein s attorneys negotiated in bad faith while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors in a written response tuesday to the palm beach daily news black disputes claims made against epstein s defense team by former u s attorney alexander acosta those and other allegations by acosta were contained in a three page letter printed friday in the online publication the daily beast acosta was the u s attorney for the southern district of florida at the time epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple sex crimes with minor girls black the miami attorney who successfully defended william kennedy smith against rape charges was part of epstein s legal dream team epstein was never charged with a federal crime he and his attorneys struck a deal with federal prosecutors which was outlined in a non prosecution agreement according to the agreement epstein had to plead guilty to two state charges register as a lifelong sex offender and serve months in jail if he successfully completed those terms and served one year of probation then epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related to approximately to victims in a written response to the daily news black said we did present argument after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against mr epstein was unsupported by the evidence we detailed the so called evidence during many meetings with prosecutors and agents we were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our investigation and i believe we made a convincing case why charges were not appropriate i still believe that today according to acosta now dean of the florida international university college of law federal prosecutors and agents met with black in the summer of the prosecutors presented epstein a choice plead guilty to state felony charges resulting in two years imprisonment registration as a sex offender and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial what followed acosta said was that epstein s defense team launched a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors i use the word assault intentionally as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which i or the prosecutors in my office had previously encountered acosta said in his letter among the legal superstars on epstein s defense team harvard professor alan dershowitz kenneth starr jay lefkowitz and several others including prosecutors who had formally worked in the u s attorney s office and in the child exploitation and obscenity section of the justice department acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him the office s excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter black said he s never heard anyone mention writing a book about the epstein case mr acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the department of justice in washington black said any person under investigation by a united states attorney meaning any of the such offices in the country has the right to seek review by the department of justice and it is so provided for in their manual thus i cannot imagine invoking this right could be construed as bad faith in our system of justice people are given the right of appeal and there should be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it finally mr acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecutors black said i am not sure what he refers to but this never happened we did point out misconduct and over reaching by certain people involved in the investigation not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a necessary part of the process there will always be people who abuse the great power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occurs the non prosecution agreement was sealed in epstein s state felony file until victims attorneys successfully argued to make the document public in september palm beach daily news march a rod escalates war with yankees team responds with a challenge embattled yankee alex rodriguez escalated his war with team higher ups via comments from his new new york lawyer suggesting

"2016-05-13 10:32","POLITICO's Morning Defense, presented by BAE Systems: Senate panel breaks with House on defense funding â€” Three deaths linked to SEAL training â€” Would registering women for the draft save money?","morningdefense@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by jeremy herb am edtwith louis nelson and connor o brienpro scoop house defense appropriations subcommittee report morning d has gotten an early copy of the house defense appropriations subcommittee report which is here for pros the subcommittee approved its defense spending bill and released a summary wednesday where we learned the panel added f s f a s an extra lcs ship and more helicopters as part of a billion shift from the overseas contingency operations fund into the base budget here s some more details from the report eelv launches the bill cuts million from the evolved expendable launch vehicle program reducing the number of launches for the next fiscal year from five to three the bill also reduces the program s infrastructure funding by million to million eelv is the air force s space launch program that pits united launch alliance against spacex more upgrades and adds the bill includes million for c upgrades an additional million for the win t radio network one additional mq triton four mq fire scouts and two more v s than requested killing jlens the bill cuts most of the million the army requested for the joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor system jlens leaving just million for the program not enough to fly the troubled surveillance blimp again sasc finishes ndaa and diverges from the house defense funding strategy our colleague connor o brien writes that senate armed services chairman john mccain r ariz broke from his house counterparts in sticking with the obama administration s billion funding level we went with the president s budget request mccain told politico but we will be trying to adjust that on the floor the decision meant that the senate armed services committee had billion less for base budget programs and many increases in the house authorization and appropriations bills aren t in the senate measure the bill does not add any extra f s or f a fighters and it sticks to two littoral combat ships as well as reaffirming defense secretary ash carter s desire to limit the program to ships and it doesn t restore the proposed end strength reductions for the army and marine corps here are some other highlights acquisition reforms mccain s bill would eliminate the pentagon s position of undersecretary for acquisition technology and logistics currently frank kendall it splits the role into two positions the undersecretary for research engineering and the renamed undersecretary of management and support the measure would also disband the f s joint program office after the program s full rate production decision in cutting stars and staff the bill would reduce the number of general and flag officers by percent cutting the number of four star billets from to it would direct the defense secretary to pick one combatant command as a pilot for an alternative organizational structure and it would limit the size of the national security council to women and the draft the senate s version of the ndaa requires women to register for the military draft starting in and creates a national commission to study the future of the selective service system russian rocket engines the measure maintains the limit of nine russian made rd engines for competitive launches included in last year s bill ula argues the number is effectively four it also adds language that would allow up to half of development funds for a new u s engine to go toward offsetting any potential increase in launch costs as a result of prohibitions on russian rocket engines immigrant visas the bill doesn t extend the afghan special immigrant visa program for translators who worked with the u s military sen jeanne shaheen d n h unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to extend the program for one year and authorize an additional visas and vowed to push a fix on the senate floor and mccain said he would work with senate judiciary chairman chuck grassley r iowa to reauthorize the program the month ahead for the four defense bills it s going to be a busy month on capitol hill for defense legislation here s a quick look at what s ahead the house national defense authorization act goes to the house rules committee monday which sets a likely tuesday start on the floor the full house appropriations committee will mark

drop out leaving many of them despondent after years of hope and preparation and months of intense training the budget question would drafting women save money it s complicated the congressional budget office s analysis of the house ndaa released wednesday estimates the bill s provision requiring women aged to register with selective service would save the government million in mandatory funding over the next years the nonpartisan scorekeeper said the savings would materialize when women who fail to register for the draft lose their eligibility for federal benefits most notably pell grants for college the cbo added it would also save an extra million in discretionary costs related to pell grants on the flipside the cbo estimates selective service would need an additional million over the next five years to pay for more staff office space and equipment to handle the influx of new registrants as well as to publicize the new requirement this is a great example of why congress

"2016-04-25 07:28","Donald Trump's Donald Trump","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," donald trump s donald trumpby glenn thrush am edtlast august roger stone had a serious falling out with his longtime friend and boss donald trump over campaign strategy he thought trump ought to have one stone trump s most influential and seasoned political adviser at the time says he quit after the do it myself billionaire rejected his plans to create a traditional campaign structure and rejected a suggestion that he seek to broaden his pitch beyond working class whites instead trump put his mouth where he wouldn t put his money opting for an on the cheap one man road show fortified by monster debate ratings and an unavoidable for comment approach to cable and network tv interviews you don t manage donald you can t deal with him on that basis stone nursing a mild martini hangover the morning after celebrating trump s blowout win in the new york primary last week explained during an hour long sit down for politico s off message podcast the year old former dick nixon dirty trickster offered a candid assessment of his longtime boss s strengths blind spots and daunting path to the presidency he envisioned a campaign which was all communications said stone who has bounced back in recent weeks to re emerge as a key adviser to trump as he faces a dangerous new phase of his storybook but the notion that you could combat let s take florida million worth of negative television simply by going on fox and friends and responding i rejected that idea stone doesn t have a formal relationship with the campaign his role is limited by his stewardship of a pro trump super pac and he wouldn t tell me how often he talks with trump or his top aides but the campaign s shotgun reorganization his former lobbying partner paul manafort has layered over stone s rival campaign manager corey lewandowski and germinal kinder gentler general election pivot bears stone s fingerprints he s going to have to better articulate himself on issues that are of concern to women stone said of trump stating an obvious truth that wasn t until recently all that obvious to a candidate who prides himself on political incorrectness he is going to have to define a pro growth more aspirational message for african american voters for hispanic voters where i actually think he can make inroads when i asked stone how trump could possibly do that and whom he should tap as a running mate he threw out john kasich s name almost by rote then he settled on a choice that seemed to better capture his imagination little marco rubio stone who worked as a dark arts political type for nixon and later ronald reagan is a paradox in wide pinstripes and oval s movie star shades he s known for scorched earth muckraking he co authored a book dredging up clinton scandals and recently emailed me to say that the clintons should be worried about him because i know exactly how to take them down yet he desperately wants trump to make his peace with women and minority voters he s the ultimate donald insider he s been on trump s payroll on and off for years but his habit of telling trump what he thinks has created an arm s length distance he s infamous for his profane tirades and crass twitter outbursts he once mocked al sharpton a onetime friend with a fried chicken joke but he s a charming conversationalist who speaks authoritatively about political biographies and pines for lazy saturdays lost in the stacks of manhattan s famous strand bookstore even his trademark a big nixon tattoo planted between his shoulder blades sends a mixed nuanced message it s not actually an expression of affection for his one time boss he likes reagan and ike a lot more idolizes his libertarian hero barry goldwater and modeled his brass knuckles approach to politics on bobby kennedy s wet work it s an homage to nixon s resilience and he had it etched on his back at a time when he was suffering from a debilitating ailment that left him bed bound deeply depressed and in need of an emotional boost still warm and fuzzy isn t stone s thing maybe that s why trump ushered him back into the fold ted cruz personally called out stone for purportedly leaking a salacious story to the national inquirer about the texas senator s alleged extramarital affairs stone has repeatedly denied he did it to me and others but he loves that cruz thinks he did it i think i m in ted cruz s head right now he s got his paid shills glenn beck and mark levin attacking me viciously stone said i have to assume that ted cruz is laying awake at night worrying about what i m doing next he hopes to play the same trick on hillary and bill clinton part of the strategy of any campaign to psych out the opposition he added there s no question that karl rove got into john kerry s head i think they re more vulnerable than most because they have more crimes to hide stone one friend told me was stung by trump s rejection of his advice and even more hurt by the developer tweeting that he d fired him but history has vindicated the son of a connecticut well digger and sicilian american mother he compared to livia tony soprano s merciless machiavellian mother in hbo s the sopranos trump s early no plan plan overseen by a surly obscure party operative named corey lewandowski worked brilliantly stone told me at least for a while that was until trump s lack of state level organizations led to defeats in wisconsin and in the delegate game in louisiana and trump s jackson pollack splattering of invective resulted in national disapproval rating pushing an unheard of percent stone believes the recent shake up is a vital first step in victory against clinton whom he sees as a weak and vulnerable foe lewandowski stone told me with a sly smile wasn t really a full service campaign director but a tour director with a narrow logistics minded approach that reminded him of his former colleague in the nixon white house john ehrlichman who served jail time for the watergate cover up you want to set up a well executed rally and create a database of all the attendees lewandowski is your guy stone said he was the right campaign manager for that model because the model consisted of a well run tour now you re just in a different phase of the campaign he added actually he reminds me more of domineering nixon chief of staff bob haldeman but maybe that s just the brush cut stone s core disagreement was never with lewandowski but with another supremely self confident novice trump his employer and friend since the late s like nearly everyone in trump s orbit stone is exceedingly reluctant to publicly criticize the boss possibly because of the non disclosure form and he thinks trump s amazing political instincts have been enough to get him this far but he believes trump could still have executed his part of the campaign the speeches the debates the media while letting professionals like stone and manafort master the details cruz s campaign has exploited in victories that have denied trump an easy path to the nomination without telling tales out of school because i have a non disclosure i envisioned a campaign that used the more traditional tools of polling and analytics and targeting and paid media and a greater depth of organization said stone but organization isn t what trump is about and stone offered tantalizing behind the scenes glimpses of a gifted self taught politician still learning a new trade a creature of habit who doesn t surf the web ever and still gets much of his news from tabloids the presidency is a drinking data through a firehose job but trump stone told me is reluctant to even sip the water fountain he finds even minimalist policy briefings to be eye glazing jeb bush level bores stone loves trump he says he s one of the funniest people he knows but conceded it s an adventure trying to counsel a reality tv billionaire who refuses to be scripted or stage managed stone paused when i asked him how he or any other adviser could change the developer s mind once trump had been set on a course of action tread lightly and keep it punchy was his best advice when you know somebody that long you get an understanding about how to affect their thinking without being you know without being insulting or overstepping a line he said nobody puts words in donald s mouth he is his own conceptualizer all you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not when you write something for him keep it short and staccato he s not going to read a page white paper on the economy zero chance of that reagan was a big picture guy trump is a big picture guy stone is sanguine about trump s chances despite predictions that he will suffer an historic electoral college blowout by the likes of larry sabato and nate silver i think that obviously he has some challenges going into the general election but i think they re all soluble stone said that doesn t mean he s not worried like most gop elders about the effect the looming convention in cleveland will have on trump s candidacy despite his own public bravado on the topic even as he was savoring the big new york win stone fretted that trump s continued insistence on whipping up his supporters to confront protesters at his rallies would ultimately backfire and possibly spark riots that would hobble his general election campaign before it begins i would suggest that we just don t step into that trap stone said this is going to be the biggest challenge in cleveland i lived through the campaign i worked for nixon i saw what the violence in chicago did to hubert humphrey s prospects any violence in cleveland would be counterproductive to trump s general election prospects this came from a man had recently suggested in watch out or you might get hit by that dump truck fashion that trump s army of supporters might want to hunt down any pledged delegates who were thinking of defecting to cruz if the convention fight came to a second ballot stone says his comment was taken out of context in no place did i advocate going and physically beating on delegates stone after all has been living on the shady outskirts of political respectability from his earliest days in politics as a year old college student working on nixon s campaign he was tasked with framing a rival politician by making a fake contribution to the socialist party with a pickle jar full of dimes and quarters his love of skullduggery also reflects a love of the theatrical another bond with trump which was fostered even earlier as a kid he grew up idolizing movie stars i wanted to be gary cooper he told me an interesting idol for a guy who likes to wear the political black hat his politics are mostly in step with trump s but he skews a lot more libertarian stone is fiscally conservative and has bonded with the boss on his opposition to the iraq war but unlike trump he s a backer of gay marriage and abortion rights when i asked him if trump s flip flop on choice was a political expedient he shakes his head and offers a personal observation i do think that the birth of his youngest child really profoundly changed his views on abortion he told me you go back and you look someplace where he was talking about this he said you know i had a friend and this friend and his wife had a baby late in his life and then it occurred to me he s talking about himself but it s a little too personal i think because he and his wife had their ten year old son barron when donald was in his s many trump surrogates refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that the great man could lose much less suffer a landslide to clinton but stone knows how tough the race will be still he argues two factors will deliver his guy to the oval office thus far secret dirt he plans to dump on the clintons and trump s innate capacity to project strength through mass media stone s relationship with trump seems to be grounded in real admiration and he confesses to have been star struck from their first meeting you know he seems greater than any mortal human he told me i ve often thought that his celebrity status was the greatest asset he brought to this enhanced enormously by seasons of the apprentice stone added i understand that elites look at that and say oh it s reality tv but to voters there s no line between the news and reality tv it s all tv it s all television if you see trump in the apprentice he s in the high backed chair he s perfectly lit he s perfectly made up he s perfectly coiffed he s perfectly dressed and he s decisive he s tough he s making decisions he looks and acts like what you think a president should be to view online "

sizable by some measures clinton reported having raised about million in march not much more than sandersâ s take in april but sanders has emerged as the biggest spending candidate in the race and his april total is not enough to maintain his pace of spending on television ads and other facets of the race last week the campaign announced that it was shedding staffers to â right sizeâ its personnel heading into the final nominating contests including indiana on tuesday the lower haul also comes as sanders is ramping up to compete against clinton in california where there are multiple media

over i think it s over now cruz cannot win trump added i m leading him by millions and millions of votes and i m leading him by delegates he cannot win the hill cyra masterindiana gov mike pence published an op ed sunday in the indianapolis star further explaining his endorsement of sen ted cruz in the gop primary â in making my decision to support ted i am guided by the principles best espoused by former president ronald reagan â the republican governor wrote â i am a reagan republican drawn to his vision of less taxes less government traditional values and a strong military ted articulates that same agenda with an unwavering devotion to our constitution the sanctity of life and the freedoms enshrined in the bill of rights â the indiana primary is tuesday and the latest polls show front runner donald trump ahead of cruz by points pence first endorsed cruz on friday but also offered praise for donald trump at the time i particularly want to commend donald trump who i think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working americans with a lack of progress in washington d c pence said friday on greg garrisonâ s radio program on wibc washington post david weigeldonald trump returned to one of his favorite subjects the canadian birth of sen ted cruz r tex at an afternoon rally inside the city s largest sports arena his cue came from the senator s wife heidi who tripped over a word at a saturday gop presidential campaign rally and appeared to say that her husband was an immigrant heidi cruz nice woman trump began she said this one my husband s an immigrant he s an immigrant that s what i ve been trying to say the line got laughs and trump seemed to find voters in the crowd who knew what he was talking about on saturday while covering heidi cruz s campaign stops around indiana washington examiner reporter byron york heard a hiccup in her patter about her husband s appeal new york times matt flegenheimer and thomas kaplanit almost resembled iowa if you squinted senator ted cruz expressed gratitude for the â common sense good judgmentâ of midwesterners his stump speech had scarcely changed from a favorite anecdote about a drawling west texas farmer to a running countdown of the time remaining before the primary â fifty one hours â he said sternly he drew a crowd of several hundred at a faith based community center here whose cheers at times coaxed the texas senator to guttural shouts one woman held a sign â prayâ n for ted â the eyes of the entire country â mr cruz said â now rest on indiana â yet two days before what is widely viewed as a must win primary mr cruz strained to conceal a grim reality he is in serious trouble the hill rebecca savranskyrepublican presidential front runner donald trump on sunday reiterated his argument that rival ted cruz can t be president because he wasnâ t born in this country â he was born in canada folks he was born in canada â trump said during a rally in indiana on sunday â no he canâ t win heâ s got no path to win and if he had a path to win which he doesnâ t he has very few votes and he has very few delegates but iâ ve been saying he wasnâ t born in this country â cruzâ s wife heidi cruz referred to her husband as an immigrant during an indiana campaign stop on saturday ted is an immigrant heidi cruz said he is hispanic we can unify this party the cruz campaign later said heidi cruz misspoke she meant to call her husband the son of an immigrant but trump used the mistake to again make the argument that cruz can t be president â his wife just said my husband is an immigrant â trump said sunday â and i said when i heard it thatâ s what iâ ve been saying â trump said if cruz were to get the nomination the first thing the democrats would do would be to bring a lawsuit against the texas senator â saying heâ s not a naturalized citizen â the hill jessie hellmannrepublican presidential hopeful ted cruz said on sunday he would continue his campaign if he lost the critical indiana primary on tuesday if you don t win in indiana under these circumstances is this race over asked fox news sunday host chris wallace of course not cruz said it s going to be a battle to see who can earn a majority of the delegates elected by the people at the convention and the reason donald is so frantic to say the race is over is because donald knows he cannot earn a majority of the delegates that were elected by the people i agree that indiana is incredibly important cruz added cruz in the days leading up to the primary has announced former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina as his running mate and gained the endorsement of indiana gov mike pence r he also cut a deal with rival ohio gov john kasich in the hopes of boosting his chances in the hoosier state in exchange for kasich pulling out of indiana thus helping cruz gain more support in the state the texas senator would forgo campaigning in new mexico and oregon to pave the way for kasich to best trump in those states the deal was struck in an attempt to stop trump from securing the gop nomination the hill jessie hellmannheidi cruz referred to husband texas sen ted cruz as an immigrant during an indiana campaign stop on saturday prompting the campaign to say she misspoke â ted is an immigrant â heidi cruz said â he is hispanic we can unify this party â a cruz aide later told the washington examiner that heidi meant to call her husband the son of an immigrant republican presidential front runner donald trump was asked about the statement in an interview sunday with fox news s geraldo rivera who is hispanic â itâ s just so bad let me tell you i assume sheâ s saying heâ s an immigrant from canada because you know he lived in canada for the first four years of his life not an immigrant like i think sheâ s referring to â trump said â sheâ s i assume referring to one of your areas of the world right geraldo cruz is from canada but his father rafael cruz was born in cuba coming to the u s in to attend the university of texas at austin trump brought up the misstep again at a campaign rally on sunday afternoon new york times jonathan martindonald j trump is leading senator ted cruz of texas by double digits in indiana according to a new nbc news wall street journal marist poll an ominous sign for mr cruz going into the crucial primary there on tuesday a loss in indiana would represent a near fatal blow to mr cruzâ s campaign and would significantly increase pressure on him to withdraw from the race the new poll released sunday shows mr trump taking percent of the vote to percent for mr cruz gov john kasich of ohio who has not been campaigning in the state by agreement with mr cruz receives percent if mr trump carries indiana which awards its delegates to the statewide winner and to the winner of each congressional district he will be far better positioned to clinch the republican nomination on june the last day of primary contests mr cruz has mounted an all out fight in indiana â convincing mr kasich to withdraw from competing there naming carly fiorina as his would be running mate at a rally in indianapolis and criss crossing the state but on saturday he gave up a full day of indiana politicking to appear at californiaâ s state republican convention with ms fiorina there he declared that â california is going to decide this republican primary â the hill kyle balluckrepublican presidential hopeful ted cruz in an interview broadcast sunday rejected the notion that the nomination of a candidate other than front runner donald trump would spark riots but he said the billionaire may try to encourage them â no it won t although donald may do everything he can to encourage riots â cruz said on cbsâ s â face the nation â the last contested convention we had in ronald reagan had a million more votes than gerald ford but gerald ford got the votes of the majority of the delegates â he said â if you look back to the very first republican convention in our very first candidate for president abraham lincoln came into a contested convention and he was second in the balloting and on the third ballot he won a majority the test is to win a majority â cruz said trump â cannot win a majority â â majorities matter and it s why donald wants to change the rules and rig the system â he added â you know i ll use a football analogy if you re on the yard line it s not a touchdown donald right now is on the yard line and he wants everyone to say â hey the game is over because you know i m past the â so what he cannot earn a majority â politico daniel straussted cruz argued that former house speaker john boehner s labeling of him as lucifer shows that the texas senator is the real outsider to the washington establishment not real estate mogul donald trump cruz made the argument during an interview with cbs john dickerson airing sunday on face the nation the comment by the republican presidential candidate comes after boehner during an appearance at stanford university on wednesday called cruz lucifer in the flesh in the cbs interview cruz moved to use the comment to bash trump the senator said trump has been trying to portray himself as some sort of outsider but that the republican front runner is actually the essence of the washington insider john boehner praised hillary clinton and he praised donald trump he said donald was his friend was his golfing and texting buddy cruz said if you think john boehner is the kind of leader you want in the republican party then donald trump is your candidate if you think nancy pelosi and harry reid are the kind of leaders you want donald trump is your candidate because he s contributed heavily to john boehner to harry reid to nancy pelosi to hillary clinton politico daniel straussit was just classic donald trump when he said hillary clinton would be getting only percent support if she were a man sen ted cruz said the texas senator and republican presidential candidate speaking in an interview with chuck todd on nbc s meet the press said the comment by trump on the night of the acela corridor primaries was just the latest in a long list of insulting comments it s typical donald trump the only thing he knows how to do in any given circumstance is he yells he screams he curses or he insults so there he s insulting hillary listen hillary is a very smart committed liberal her policies are profoundly wrong cruz said in the interview airing sunday on tuesday trump said if hillary clinton were a man i donâ t think sheâ d get percent of the vote adding the beautiful thing is women don t like her but the irony cruz claimed is that trump actually supports the same policies as clinton washington post elise viebecksen ted cruz would not say despite repeated questioning whether he would support donald trump as the republican nominee for president i believe that if the republican party nominates donald trump we will lose to hillary the senator from texas said in an interview with nbc s meet the press what followed was a five minute back and forth in which cruz repeatedly dodged the same question posed by nbc anchor chuck todd i recognize that many in the media would love for me to surrender to donald trump the media has given billion of free advertising to trump i am going to beat donald trump we are headed to a contested convention and i am not willing to concede this country cruz said let the record show you have not taken a position on whether you can support trump if he s the nominee todd said cruz appearing on all five political talk shows on sunday morning argued that his campaign is seeing incredible momentum in indiana which holds its gop primary tuesday after an endorsement from gov mike pence r new york times trip gabrielas the presidential race came to indiana candidates of both parties seized on a fresh example in this industrial state of factory jobs being shipped abroad â is anyone here from carrier â donald j trump called out in evansville ind last week referring to the carrier corporationâ s closing of factories that make heating and air conditioning units â they let go of people to move to mexico â mr trump said â and you know what they have to pay a consequence â at a union rally the next day at the state capitol senator bernie sanders of vermont thundered a message to the chief executive of united technologies carrierâ s parent company â stop the greed â he shouted â stop destroying the middle class in america respect your workers â the picture of manufacturing decline and middle class retreat has become a driving narrative of the presidential race spawning economic populism on both the left and the right yet indiana which holds its primary on tuesday defies an easy picture of rust belt decline by many measures the state is humming economically offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters new york times jeremy w peterseven as donald j trump trounced him from new hampshire to florida to arizona senator ted cruz could reassure himself with one crucial advantage he was beating mr trump in the obscure internecine delegate fights that could end up deciding the republican nomination for president â this is how elections are won in america â mr cruz gloated after walking away with the most delegates in wyoming but it turns out that delegates â like ordinary voters â are susceptible to shifts in public opinion and as the gravitational pull of mr trumpâ s recent primary landslides draws more republicans toward him mr cruzâ s support among the partyâ s convention delegates is softening threatening his hopes of preventing mr trumpâ s nomination by overtaking him in a floor fight with each delegate mr trump claims he gets closer to the he needs to clinch the nomination outright and mr cruzâ s chances of stopping him â even if he pulls out a victory in tuesdayâ s indiana primary â shrink the hill jessie hellmannrepublican presidential candidate john kasich helped a high school student ask her crush to prom â but it still wasnâ t enough for the ohio governor to secure her vote â hey nico it would be â kay sickâ if you would go to the prom with julia â the ohio governor said in an eight second video with the girl abc news reported julia later tweeted that the promposal was successful â he said yes â she said but she and her date still plan to vote for democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton in the california primary she told abc news vanity fair charles bramescothough the official party nominees for the upcoming presidential election wonâ t be named until the respective conventions this summer it appears that former secretary of state hillary clinton and presumable human man donald trump have the game sewn up tight but even with their nominations all but inevitable that hasnâ t stopped the other nominees from keeping on ted cruz earned a sweetly condescending â alright liâ l guyâ from the people of america when he declared earlier this week that carly fiorina would be his running mate in the event that he wins the republican nomination and john kasich hasnâ t allowed his nearly inevitable failure to stall him one mite either kasich has garnered a slight bump in popularity over the past couple weeks by presenting himself as a slightly cooler headed moderate alternative to the sentient orange cyclone and former munsters cast member against which heâ s campaigning nbc news has the full report from a kasich appearance on friday in the queer rights hub of san francisco where the candidate was appropriately questioned about his stance on lgbtq issues editorials op edsnew york times editorial boardit is an old congressional ritual loading up vital spending bills that are meant to keep the government running with dangerous amendments aimed at satisfying ideological causes and benefiting special interests the republicans have become adept at this practice in recent years and this year is no different legislative riders attached to appropriations bills would undermine the iran nuclear deal weaken highway safety and reduce the food and drug administrationâ s authority over tobacco products these measures would be unlikely to succeed as stand alone bills either because they could not get enough votes on their own or because president obama would veto them so better to sneak them in without even holding hearings to make a case on their behalf new york times editorial boardexcited to participate in the presidential election more than people in kansas applied to register to vote in a three week period in february just days before the state presidential caucuses it was a reassuring display of democracy â except that two thirds of that group remain officially held â in suspense â unregistered and unable to vote this is because they have not met the draconian requirement of the state law approved by the republican legislature that they provide a passport birth certificate or naturalization papers this electoral limbo amounts to crude voter suppression and no one seems certain whether all qualified citizens in kansas will be allowed to vote in the primary election in august for state offices and in the november general election court challenges are underway with the american civil liberties union documenting what it calls the â chaosâ wrought by the state law it stands contrary to federal law which allows people to register when they get a driverâ s license or state id and attest under criminal threat of perjury that they are citizens washington post editorial boardâ the beatings will continue until morale improves â a famously ironic phrase of unknown origin aptly describes the republican house approach to the internal revenue service the house has passed a series of sniping counterproductive measures picking on the irs one would limit how it spends the user fees it collects another would freeze hiring at the understaffed agency until it obtains certification that no one there has major tax debt the dumbest would mandate that no one at the irs could get a bonus until customer service improves but who is responsible for the decline of customer service at the irs house republicans the irs budget is million below its level in the year that republicans won control of the house it has been forced to shed workers meanwhile its responsibilities have increased more people are filing taxes the agency has to administer key parts of the affordable care act cyberthreats have skyrocketed including instances of identity theft washington post editorial boardeveryone complains about the high cost of prescription drugs but not many people try to do anything about it an admirable exception is the department of health and human services hhs which recently proposed a pilot program to change the way medicare reimburses doctors for medications they administer directly to patients as opposed to those distributed through pharmacies or hospitals at present the doctor gets the average price of a drug plus percent a clear incentive to use higher priced drugs instead of lower priced equivalents hhs wants to make the reimbursement percent plus a flat fee the idea is to curb medicare spending on physician dispensed drugs â which grew from billion in to billion in â without harming quality of care alas there is now an uproar against the proposal on capitol hill where the two interest groups most affected the pharmaceutical industry and certain medical specialties such as oncology have immense clout all republicans on the senate finance committee are demanding the obama administration withdraw the proposal â and all democrats on the committee have signed a letter raising their â concerns â new york times editorial boardeight justices heard oral arguments in the final case of the supreme courtâ s term on wednesday when will the court return to full strength that question is as urgent today as it was immediately after the death two and a half months ago of justice antonin scalia but the initial wave of outrage at the senate republicansâ hard line refusal to consider replacing justice scalia has ebbed making it that much easier for republicans to keep the seat empty through the presidential election if they succeed the court will go nearly two terms and possibly longer without a ninth member the consequences of the impasse have been growing graver by the day already the justices have split to in two cases leaving important legal issues unresolved in one the court failed to decide a major labor case involving the longstanding right of public sector unions which represent millions of american workers to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers by the termâ s end in late june itâ s likely that several more cases will have ended in tie votes including possibly the fights over abortion

the national convention in philadelphia and how he handles the next months said sen jeanne shaheen d n h who says she was heckled for the first time in her life by sanders supporters during the new

real?","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edttrump s magical thinking tax plan in one of the more inexplicably bizarre statements of an already bizarre campaign donald trump economic adviser sam clovis suggested the real estate magnate s tax cut plan could generate a government surplus of as much as trillion over years this is to put it mildly complete nonsense our proposals what we think will happen will lead us in fact to about a to trillion surplus at the end of years if all of our initiatives are put in place clovis said at the peterson foundation fiscal summit the conservative tax foundation scored trump s current plan now subject to possibly endless revision as adding trillion to the debt over ten years clovis complained that the foundation did not use dynamic scoring which takes into account the potential growth effects of tax reductions the only problem with this they did use dynamic scoring to get to the trillion figure when scoring on a static basis the group said trump s plan would cost trillion there is simply no way to get to clovis estimate without massive tax hikes treasury departure lounge anne wall assistant secretary for legislative affairs is headed out treasury secretary jack lew on wall s tenure for five years including for the last two years at treasury i have relied on the sound advice and strategic judgment of anne wall who brought a special combination of determination humor and a comprehensive understanding of policy and congress to her role as assistant secretary for legislative affairs anne played a pivotal role in securing some of treasury s signature policy accomplishments including trade promotion authority imf quota reform and the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran as well as in protecting key administration priorities including the affordable care act and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act trump won t release returns politico s nolan d mccaskill donald trump has no plans to release his tax returns before november despite pressure from his now vanquished republican rivals and even gop presidential nominee mitt romney trump has refused to oblige there s nothing to learn from them the presumptive nominee told the associated press in an interview conducted tuesday and published wednesday hard to see how trump gets away without releasing his returns a tradition though not a requirement for presidential candidates he would be the first major party candidate to not release returns since gerald ford in trump has said he cannot release returns because they are under irs audit this of course is entirely untrue there is nothing stopping him from releasing the returns as cnn money reported on wednesday even richard nixon released returns that were under irs audit the only conclusion that can be drawn is that trump is hiding damaging information in his tax returns he is likely to come under intense pressure both from democrats hillary clinton jumped on it wednesday and members of his own party mitt romney rep darrell issa among others so far to release the returns but wait maybe he will trump on wednesday night on fox denied he told the ap he wouldn t release his returns i didn t say that i said i m being audited so the answer is i ll release hopefully before the election i ll release trump opponents are already circulating lists of reasons they think trump might be hiding his returns among them trump s taxes could show that he doesn t make nearly as much money as he suggests trump probably reports relatively little taxable income trump may lower his taxes by deducting parts of his lifestyle as business expenses and borrowing against his assets trump s tax returns may show that his most valuable asset his name belongs to an offshore shell company old tax filings show that trump had negative income due to depreciation in trump may be using real estate depreciation to lower his income possibly to below zero sen ted cruz has speculated that trump s tax returns may contain evidence of his ties to organized crime cruz suggested trump s tax returns may show significant donations to left wing organizations including planned parenthood trump s returns may show his unwillingness to give to charity already evinced by his paltry support of his own foundation trump clinton tied reuters trump pulled even with democratic rival hillary clinton in a reuters ipsos opinion poll released on wednesday in a dramatic early sign that the nov presidential election might be more hotly contested than

and non compete agreements america s economy continues to come back creating million private sector jobs over the longest streak of job growth on record straight months but too many americans still aren t sharing in the benefits of that economic progress one reason for that is that too often large corporations are stifling fair competition and stacking the deck against workers entrepreneurs and consumers today the administration highlighted important pieces of progress toward addressing these kinds of unfair practices mandatory arbitration clauses and the improper use of non compete agreements first today the independent consumer financial protection bureau put out a new proposal that is designed to crack down on the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in recent years many financial products from bank accounts to credit cards have found a way to avoid accountability by burying mandatory arbitration clauses deep in the fine print of hundreds of millions of contracts mandatory arbitration clauses deny consumers the ability to join their resources band together with others who have been harmed and get their day in court that s just not right today s action is yet another example of the important work of the cfpb which was created by wall street reform in addition to writing stronger rules of the road for mortgages credit cards and student loans through enforcement actions the bureau has put nearly billion back in the pockets of more than million consumers who have been harmed by illegal practices that s why the president fought so hard to create a strong cfpb and why it s so appalling that republicans in congress have proposed to repeal the cfpb in their budget also today the white house released a report underscoring the need to reform the use of non compete agreements which deny workers the ability to leave a company and go work for another company in the same industry far too often these agreements aren t credibly protecting trade secrets instead they re unnecessary roadblocks for workers trying to get a raise move up by joining another employer or start their own company nearly one in five workers including percent of low wage workers are subject to them that holds their bargaining power and their wages down in the coming months the administration will build on the examples of states that have taken actions highlighted in the report and put forward possible options for reform and encourage more states to take action and to make sure employers are treating their employees fairly the president knows that the best way to make sure everyone shares in our economic success is through healthy competition and stronger protections that guarantee consumers are treated fairly that s what today s actions to combat both of these unfair practices are about cinco de mayocinco de mayo is a day to celebrate the important cultural contributions of our nation s mexican american and hispanic community despite unprecedented political opposition president obama has taken on big challenges that washington has ignored for decades and made real progress the obama administration s has expanded job opportunitieso under president obama million private sector jobs have been added over consecutive months including million jobs over the last months the longest streak of private sector job growth on record o hispanic unemployment rate has dropped from its peak of percent in august to percent in march increased access to affordable quality healthcareo due to the affordable care act aca the uninsured rate among hispanics adults

including immunizations and certain cancer screenings with no co pay or deductible o teen birth rates fell nearly percent among hispanic teens dropping the national teen birth rate to an all time low ensured our youth can reach their full potentialo more than million hispanic children close to half of latinos under the age of five have benefited from race to the top early learning challenge grants o over the last decade hispanic students dropout rate was cut by more than half and graduation rates have risen to percent up percentage points since o more hispanic students are graduating college than ever before now more students are completing a bachelor s degree annually in the academic year more than hispanic students completed their college degree made the dream of homeownership within reacho the federal housing administration reduced the annual premiums for new borrowers by half of a percentage point making homeownership more affordable for responsible hispanic families more than half of hispanic first time homebuyers use an fha insured loan taken action to fix our broken immigration systemo in november president obama took steps within his authority to fix our broken immigration system the deferred action policies he announced would provide greater opportunities for immigrants who came to our nation as children and parents of u s citizens and lawful permanent residents who have lived here for years the administration continues to defend these policies in court in order to be able to implement them o since the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca policy has allowed more than young dreamers to go to school and work legally the vast majority of daca recipients are hispanic o president obama established the white house task force on new americans to support the integration of immigrants and refugees into our communities including linguistic civic and economic integration o the president launched the stand stronger citizenship awareness campaign which aims to promote the rights responsibilities and opportunities of citizenship among the million lawful permanent residents potentially eligible to become u s citizens more than million of these eligible individuals are hispanic strengthened our relationship with latin americao president obama s trip to cuba marked a historic milestone in the normalization process between the united states and cuba the administration has worked with the cubans to ease travel restrictions facilitate commerce enhance people to people engagement expand business and commercial ties and continue the call and support for human rights and civil society in cuba o the president has prioritized support to central america in an effort to see an economically integrated central america that is fully

"2016-05-04 12:01","POLITICO's Morning Transportation: NTSB and DOT go head-to-head on WMATA oversight â€” FAA suggests flexible funding on airport rail projects â€” Trucking Alliance opposes controversial THUD rider","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from lauren gardner and cogan schneierntsb and dot go head to head on wmata oversight the national transportation safety board s five hour meeting on the l enfant plaza tragedy on tuesday started as a critique of inadequate wmata and local safety oversight more on that below then it morphed into a veritable ntsb vs dot smackdown in which ntsb chairman christopher hart lambasted the federal government for failing to provide proper oversight time and time again and the dot lobbed responses right back accusing the ntsb of being overly fixated on putting oversight responsibilities into the hands of the federal railroad administration instead of the federal transit administration now here s the big question will dot budge it doesn t seem likely i have no uncertainties about the fta wmata safety oversight role transportation secretary anthony foxx wrote in a letter to hart released moments after the conclusion of the meeting what s the deal with the fra our lauren gardner explains why there s such a strong push to hand over the oversight reins to the fra first and foremost the agency can levy fines on railroads an enforcement stick that fta doesn t have map granted fta greater regulatory authority over the nation s transit systems but ntsb staffer michael hiller said it didn t end the agency s reliance on states to oversee them lauren writes foxx and fta officials argue the agency s power to withhold federal funding from transit agencies or to direct the money to be spent on safety specific needs is an influential tool but even former acting administrator therese mcmillan conceded to politico last year that having the ability to levy hefty penalties would be useful nothing would force a transit agency to adopt fta s safety standards and even if they did there would be nothing compelling them to correct any discrepancies meanwhile fra has uniform minimum standards for commuter railroads plus a nationwide network of inspectors ntsb lead investigator joe gordon said not gonna happen foxx says the ntsb s full report and recommendations on the january incident won t be available for several weeks as agency staff tidy up final details but foxx was already quick to offer a defense saying he wouldn t have been able to give the fra permanent oversight of wmata without an act of congress anyway had we taken the ntsb recommendations whole cloth it is entirely possible that we would still be awaiting such congressional action and that the many oversight activities already undertaken by the fta would not have happened in that vacuum foxx said in my judgment we have taken the substance of the ntsb recommendations using the fastest most effective method available to us and if that wasn t enough a dot spokesman said the department can t just flip a switch and move safety oversight to the fra adding we find the ntsb s continued fixation with fra oversight confounding and counterproductive throwing some serious shade hart s closing statement seemed aimed directly at foxx who said three months ago that baby sitting the safety oversight of wmata is not one of our most prized things to be doing it is meant to be a limited mission hart apparently was unimpressed by that statement the department of transportation has emphasized the temporary nature of direct fta safety oversight over wmata at one point referring to this role as baby sitting hart told the room full of agency officials and reporters on tuesday safety oversight is not baby sitting it is an ongoing far reaching responsibility sounds like hart doesn t want dot to drop the babysitting gig anytime soon it s wednesday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains planes automobiles and ports after all that talk yesterday s about through the roof airline profits loyal mt reader ben cornelius brought our attention to this timely installment of the comic strip pearls before swine from monday bit ly ntsglu send tips greetings comics to mpowers politico com or martinepowers i be pullin up stuff in the phantom ship i got plenty of stuff of bugatti whip look how i drive the root of the problem ntsb investigators determined that the cause of the smoke incident was a prolonged short circuit made possible by a pattern of inadequate inspections and deferred upkeep that burned power components they said it had been clear for years that tunnel and train ventilation systems were inadequate but wmata officials had ignored warnings to update the system and staff members were not sufficiently trained on how to properly employ the fans in an emergency the board also outlined a series of communications problems that prevented emergency responders from reaching the affected train more quickly and prolonged the time during which the train stayed immobile inside the smoke filled tunnel the four member board unanimously agreed that wmata s senior management failed to proactively manage safety risks reactions from the hill sen barbara mikulski on the ntsb s findings most disturbing is that the ntsb had flagged many of these safety gaps in previous investigations and yet metro failed to take action now we need a rapid response from metro to implement these recommendations sens mark warner and tim kaine these steps must be the start of a sustained effort to overhaul metro as congress grapples with the long term federal role in funding metro the best case we could make to our colleagues would be tangible progress by wmata management on addressing every deficiency identified in this report a packed agenda d c del eleanor holmes norton says she plans to talk with the fra about the ntsb s findings and recommendations along with their follow up to the csx derailment during her meeting with the agency today she s also planning on a meeting with foxx funding for rail projects should be more flexible faa suggests the faa is seeking public comment after releasing a federal register notice on proposed changes to how airport passenger facility charges can be used for airport rail projects currently pfc funds can only be spent on rail projects that are used by airport customers and employees exclusively under a new proposal that criteria would be more flexible based on the faa s experience the agency believes the current eligibility criteria for pfc funding of rail projects may be too stringent and should be reevaluated the faa wrote in a statement the proposed policy change may provide greater access to the nation s airports through intermodal transportation connections not so easy rider the trucking alliance says it opposes the controversial trucking rider in the senate s thud appropriations bill the alliance supports the technical correction language in the first sentence but prefers that congress not codify the second sentence which goes into the hour in a day period phrase we are urging the house appropriations committee to avoid inserting this language as well the group said in a statement congress has mandated that interstate trucking companies install electronic logging devices by december to verify truck driver hours of service compliance the statistical data produced by this technology should guide future changes in truck driver hours of service rules rather than a political decision by congress the trucking alliance also cited concerns about fmcsa relinquishing its rulemaking authority and concerns about potentials for widespread confusion throughout the industry cargo concerns after the department of homeland security ruled to delay the implementation of a law to scan all incoming cargo at u s ports rep janice hahn d calif raised grave concerns about the holdup saying in a statement that she is kept up at night by the thought of a terrorist attack at the port of los angeles or the port of long beach the importance of this mandate cannot be understated and yet the department of homeland security has now issued its third delay to date we are physically scanning just percent of all incoming cargo critics of the law have said it would be prohibitively costly new addition fresh off a stint with hillary for america clark pettig will become dot s newest

military programs the house of representatives draft of the billion national defense authorization act or ndaa which sets spending policy for the department of defense would shift billion of wartime overseas contingency operations or oco funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs the obama administration objects to the use of that money saying it threatens u s security and unfairly spares the pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education new york times julie davispresident obama on monday made an impassioned argument for his administrationâ s decision to instruct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity saying that society must protect the dignity and safety of vulnerable children the remarks were the presidentâ s first public comments on a directive released friday that has added fuel to a searing national debate over transgender rights mr obama said the guidance issued by the education and justice departments represented â our best judgmentâ on how to help schools wrestling with the issue â weâ re talking about kids and anybody whoâ s been in school been in high school whoâ s been a parent i think should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority â kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender â are subject to a lot of bullying potentially they are vulnerable â mr obama said in an interview with buzzfeed news washington post philip rucker and robert costadonald trump vowed monday that if elected president he would rescind the obama administration s new directives aimed at protecting transgender people against discrimination in schools and health care coverage but even as trump accused the administration of federal overreach and argued that such matters should be addressed by the states the republican party s presumptive nominee also sounded a more compassionate tone and offered a more nuanced outlook than many of his party s elected leaders trump said in an interview with the washington post that the government must act to protect all people and that he was eager to learn more about the movement

the governmentâ s health care law sent the matter back to lower courts to seek a compromise between the parties the move monday prolongs the four year fight over whether the groups must offer contraception coverage under the affordable care act it also highlights how justice antonin scaliaâ s february death has hobbled the ability of the courtâ s eight remaining members to resolve the most contentious cases in a brief unsigned opinion that chief justice john roberts summarized from the bench the justices returned the contraception issue to the lower courts to review whether recent

â the tom anderson show â a morning radio program on monday he teased a scoop ahead of the formal release of â who the policy platform committee members and honorary co chairs will be for the trump alaska organization donâ t miss it big names â politico shane goldmacherdonald trump likes to say he has created a political movement that has drawn â millions and millionsâ of new voters into the republican party â itâ s the biggest thing happening in politics â trump has said â all over the world theyâ re talking about it â he s bragged but a politico analysis of the early voting data show that so far itâ s just not true while trumpâ s insurgent candidacy has spurred record setting republican primary turnout in state after state the early statistics show that the vast majority of those voters arenâ t actually new to voting or to the republican party but rather they are reliable past voters in general elections they are only casting ballots in a republican primary for the first time it is a distinction with profound consequences for the fall campaign if trump isnâ t bringing the promised wave of new voters into the gop itâ s far less likely the manhattan businessman can transform a electoral college map that begins tilted against the republican party and whether trumpâ s voters are truly new is a question of urgent interest both to gop operatives and hillary clinton and her allies who have dispatched their top analytics experts to find the answer wall street journal aaron zitner and dante chinniin this city of shuttered factories and falling incomes donald trumpâ s swagger and promises to get tough with trading partners have rallied republicans and shown signs of drawing working class voters to the party a short distance away in the thriving office parks of montgomery county republicans worry that those same qualities are repelling upper income gop voters thatâ s the tricky electoral math that mr trump faces in an expected general election push to win pennsylvania and industrial midwest states that havenâ t backed a republican for president in decades mr trumpâ s working class appeal has helped add new republicans to the voter rolls in the area around reading one of the nationâ s poorest cities but in adjacent and more populous montgomery county which borders philadelphia republicans fear mr trump could amplify a recent tilt into the democratic camp democrats in recent months there have made bigger gains than the gop in voter registration roll call lisa hagenmore than half of republican voters trust presumptive gop nominee donald trump to lead the party over speaker paul ryan r wis a new national poll released tuesday finds a nbc news surveymonkey online tracking poll found that six in republicans and gop leaners trust trump more than the speaker while only four in trust ryan more republicans who describe themselves as very conservative are more trusting of trump than of ryan to percent compared to those who describe themselves as conservative or moderate last week trump and ryan met to attempt to mend fences the house speaker still hasnâ t endorsed the real estate mogul but ryan said the two will have additional conversations in the coming months the wisconsin republican also said both men are â totally committed to working together to achieveâ party unity the poll was conducted may and surveyed adults including who say theyâ re registered voters via online the margin of error was points new york times ashley parker and jonathan martindonald j trump recently coined a dismissive nickname for senator bernie sanders â crazy bernie â but that has not stopped mr trump from borrowing lessons from mr sanders â the vermont senator whom he also frequently praises from the stump â on how to run against hillary clinton his likely opponent in the general election on a range of issues mr trump seems to be taking a page from the sanders playbook expressing a willingness to increase the minimum wage suggesting that the wealthy may pay higher taxes than under his original proposal attacking mrs clinton from the left on national security and wall street and making clear that his opposition to free trade will be a centerpiece of his general election campaign as mr trump lays the groundwork for his likely showdown with mrs clinton he is staking out a series of populist positions that could help him woo working class democrats in november but in doing so he is exacerbating the trepidation some republicans already feel about his candidacy at a moment when the party typically rallies to its nominee politico steven shepardhe ran away with the republican presidential nomination but americaâ s pollsters are still trying to figure out donald trump ten months after the new york billionaire announced his white house bid pollsters are grappling with his force of nature candidacy and the many questions it raises for their industry will he produce a surge of new voters that they canâ t predict will voters be less likely to admit to live pollsters that they intend to support him in november and given the talk of a potential third party candidacy how would that prospect scramble the polls with the polling industry in a state of unprecedented flux â torn between longstanding gold standard practices that are gradually giving way to largely untested new approaches â the uncertainty surrounding a november matchup between trump and democratic front runner hillary clinton dominated talk in the hallways here at this past weekendâ s american association for public opinion research annual conference after a number of high profile misses in recent years the additional layers of uncertainty in raise the prospect that pollsters could muff the most closely watched election in a generation washington post eugene robinsondonald trumpâ s opponents in the primaries were right to call him a con artist a narcissist and a pathological liar just ask â john miller â thatâ s one of the names trump used with journalists to burnish his status as a bold faced manhattan celebrity he also called himself â john barron â both personae were supposedly publicists who just wanted to explain what a wonderful guy mr â trump was and how beautiful women seemed unable to resist his charms last week the post ran an article about the â millerâ and â barronâ ruses which took place years ago and posted a recording of â millerâ explaining why trump was dumping marla maples â heâ s coming out of a marriage and heâ s starting to do tremendously well financially â the imaginary publicist says to a reporter from people magazine â actresses just call to see if they can go out with him and things â madonna is ostentatiously name dropped as someone who â wanted to go out with him â the voice is trumpâ s he denies it for some reason â â i donâ t think it was me â he said friday â it doesnâ t sound like meâ â but the timbre cadence and word choice on the recording are pure trump it could only be him or his evil twin as if he needed one washington post michael gersonin the category of credit where credit is due donald trump has been exactly right in one important respect he attacked the republican establishment as low energy cowering weaklings now republican leaders are lining up to surrender to him â like low energy cowering weaklings the capitulation has justified the accusation it would be impolite to name names so i should not mention that former texas governor rick perry who now angles for trumpâ s vice presidential nod once said â he offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as trumpism a toxic mix of demagoguery mean spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the republican party to perdition if pursued let no one be mistaken â donald trumpâ s candidacy is a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed excised and discarded â i should resist the temptation to recall how rep peter king n y who now reluctantly backs trump once asserted he is â not fit to be president morally or intellectually â washington post ed oâ keefe and david weigelthe top ranks of the republican party may be coalescing around donald trump but grass roots conservative activists are still trying to find a way to stop him at the partyâ s convention in july angered by trumpâ s shifting views on taxes the minimum wage national security and how little he discusses social issues conservatives across the country are studying the party rule book for last ditch moves they could make when the convention begins in cleveland veteran republican campaign operatives familiar with convention planning are offering to educate delegates on how they can act as free agents even if the republican national committee insists that delegates adhere to the results of their state primary some even talk about convening somewhere other than the convention site editorials op edschicago tribune the editorial boardlife is full of unpleasant but inescapable obligations paying your taxes laughing at your boss jokes waiting for the cable guy some tasks are even more unpleasant but thankfully optional for republican officeholders and candidates endorsing donald trump for president falls into the latter category having been around for years we at the chicago tribune know something about the rewards and risks of making endorsements for office we spend a lot of time each election compiling questionnaires for candidates evaluating their answers interviewing them and debating their merits then in almost every race we give one candidate our imprimatur new york times the editorial boardevery day that passes without a ninth justice undermines the supreme courtâ s ability to function and leaves millions of americans waiting for justice or clarity as major legal questions are unresolved on monday the eight member court avoided issuing a ruling on one of this termâ s biggest cases zubik v burwell which challenges the affordable care actâ s requirement that employersâ health care plans cover the cost of birth control for their employees in an unsigned opinion the court sent the lawsuits back to the lower federal courts with instructions to try to craft a compromise that would be acceptable to everyone this is the second time since justice antonin scaliaâ s death in february that the court has failed to reach a decision in a high profile case in march the court split to in a labor case involving the longstanding right of public sector unions which represent millions of american workers to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers washington post editorial boardthe past weekend brought yet more evidence of donald trumpâ s contempt for truth and essential political standards yet the reality television star continued to consolidate gop support a fact punctuated by republican national committee chairman reince priebusâ s tour on sunday morning television in which he argued that the â sort of traditional review and analysis of individual candidates has not applied to donald trump â because mr trump is a different kind of candidate â â a total outsider thatâ s going to cause an earthquake in washington â in fact it is all the more important that voters see mr trumpâ s full business and financial record precisely because he lacks a history of public service on which to judge his suitability how then can mr priebus argue that basic standards such as honesty and transparency do not apply because he explained voters do not seem to care about them â at least not so far and if voters donâ t care mr priebus doesnâ t care â we want to win in november and donald trump is someone who has been winning â this is not the first time that the chairman has exposed the rank nihilism that is driving republican leadersâ acceptance of mr trump and mr priebus is far from alone even sen john mccain ariz â a war hero whose service mr trump ridiculed a man who disagrees with mr trump on issue after issue not to mention on how the nationâ s politics should be conducted â has somehow found his way to backing the billionaire but winning cannot excuse lying debasing the countryâ s politics and driving wedges among its people washington post editorial boardarticulating his view of judicial restraint during an address to georgetown university law graduates in chief justice john g roberts jr said that the supreme court should keep its rulings limited strictly to the issues squarely before it because as he put it â if it is not necessary to decide more to a case â â it is necessary not to decide more â that doctrine of avoidance goes double for cases in which it is impossible for the court to decide anything at all â or so it would seem based on the justicesâ hyper cautious disposition monday of a controversial case involving religious freedom objections to the contraceptive mandate under the affordable care act certain religiously affiliated nonprofit groups that provide health insurance coverage to their workers object to a workaround the government devised to accommodate their theological opposition to contraception in essence it would allow groups that fill out a written notification form to have their employees obtain contraception coverage through a separate insurance account however the groups argued that even that minimal step forced them actively to promote a process that ends in the provision of contraception thus imposing a â substantialâ burden on their free exercise of religion "

democratic primary race hillary clinton has turned down an invitation to debate senator bernie sanders ahead of california s primary her campaign said on monday the announcement came hours after mrs clinton unleashed a biting critique of donald j trump while addressing a union convention mocking his business record and offering a glimpse at how she might confront him in the general election mr sanders s campaign last week tentatively accepted an invitation by fox news to participate in a debate before california s june primary and expressed hope that mrs clinton would agree to face off against the senator in a statement issued monday evening a spokeswoman for mrs clinton s campaign jennifer palmieri said mrs clinton s team would contest california while turning our attention to the threat a donald trump presidency poses we ve known for some time that hillary clinton will almost certainly be the democratic nominee but when will she clinch the nomination if you look at the few remaining contests on the democratic primary calendar the major news outlets barring something devastating happening to the clinton campaign in the next few weeks are likely to declare clinton the nominee on june more specifically new jersey will likely push clinton across the finish line and she may clinch the nomination even before the polls close in california if major news outlets declare clinton the nominee on june they will be counting superdelegates as they did in when they declared barack obama the presumptive democratic nominee on june now you might ask why include superdelegates it s a fair question superdelegates can change their minds after all for that reason we haven t included them in our delegate tracker there was a chance that superdelegates backing clinton might switch sides particularly if sanders was able to win a majority of elected delegates hillary clinton will almost certainly clinch the democratic nomination with the aid of superdelegates and it is not uncommon for a democratic candidate to do so in a competitive late season primary barack obama also needed a boost from superdelegates in though clinton is relying slightly more on superdelegates than mr obama did who are the superdelegates since the democratic party has set aside seats at its convention for party leaders including democratic members of congress governors past presidents and members of the democratic national committee giving these leaders a role in choosing the nominee these delegates are commonly referred to as superdelegates superdelegates or unpledged delegates serve by virtue of their party position or elected office they are not bound by state primaries and caucuses and can back any candidate they prefer at the convention they can also change their minds at any time superdelegates make up about percent of the total number of democratic delegates and percent of the number needed to nominate i agents probing whether hillary clinton s use of a private email server imperiled government secrets appear close to completing their work a process experts say will probably culminate in a sit down with the former secretary of state the fbi has already spoken with huma abedin a clinton confidant who was among the democratic presidential front runner s closest aides at the state department former chief of staff cheryl d mills is also cooperating with the investigation according to her lawyer bernie sandersbernie sanders s beliefs have been obvious from the start he thinks wealthy elites exert too much influence over american politics he wants the u s government to lessen income inequality he believes climate change is a pressing threat to the world the clarity and overarching ambition of his agenda has been central to his appeal and expectations defying political success so far if sanders wants his political revolution to last he will need to win widespread support for his ideas well into the future yet as the primary election draws to a close the campaign has increasingly made arguments that may undercut the long term viability of the movement that has coalesced around the vermont senator in a move meant to cool down tensions between his campaign and the democratic establishment the democratic party will give sen bernie sanders i vt a greater role to play in establishing its platform at this summer s democratic national convention under an agreement the party reached with sanders and opponent hillary clinton sanders can select five people to serve on the party s platform committee a third of the committee s members clinton will name six members and rep debbie wasserman schultz fla the party chair will name four according to the washington post it looks like bernie sanders s political agitation is paying off the democratic national convention committee announced the members of its platform drafting committee on monday a selection designed to give the vermont senator an unusual amount of influence on the process as the washington post reported party leaders hope the move will soothe a bitter split with backers of the long shot challenger to hillary clinton sanders has been allowed to name five members to the committee charged with writing the party platform while clinton named six the tally reflects the fact that clinton leads sanders in the popular vote for the presidential primary election but nevertheless grants sanders allies a significant amount of input tommy chong is in disbelief after he was disinvited by the bernie sanders campaign from introducing the presidential hopeful hours before a rally in east los angeles the iconic comic actor and outspoken marijuana advocate tells the hollywood reporter that the sanders campaign was happy to have his endorsement months back but when it came time for the two men to appear in public together someone got cold feet he says it s lip service to get the votes but they don t want to endorse what i stand for and what i ve stood for all my professional career chong said right after he was uninvited to the rally it was an insult in an email to thr a sanders spokesman said we appreciate his support but a scheduling issue came up chong who was invited on sunday to sanders noon rally in lincoln park says he is sure the campaign put distance between himself and sanders over the marijuana issue calling the move a weakness by the sanders camp he joked that his hair and makeup were done for nothing republican party candidatesdonald trumpdonald trump is holding his first campaign fundraiser tuesday in the very difficult to spell albuquerque as he sets about trying to meet his self proclaimed goal of raising billion for his presidential election a long way from his days proclaiming to self fund his campaign to date trump has spent more than million of his own cash on his campaign in the form of loans but has assured donors he won t use their cash to repay himself but while trump is throwing around the huge number senior aides are cautioning his that it s an unrealistic total requiring the candidate to raise an average of roughly million every day through november a more reasonable goal they say is between m m while some donors are still firmly in the nevertrump camp trump s challenge won t be from opponents but from the absence of an organized financial network noam chomsky the celebrated linguist and left wing political theorist was recently asked to contemplate the consequences of a trump presidency well first we have to ask if he means what he s saying the elderly intellectual replied if he does the human species is in very deep trouble chomsky paused and his audience had a moment to wonder which trump gaffe had so galled the patron saint of the american left was it his plan to take out terrorists families or the full throated defense of military torture the donald s praise for punching protesters or that loose talk about using nukes as it happened the mit professor wasn t primarily concerned by all the utterances that make trump a unique figure in american politics rather he was most troubled by a statement that makes him all too typical as a presidential candidate donald trump has taken a pretty hard line on climate change he has said that he is not a great believer in man made climate change has called it a total very expensive hoax and has blamed the chinese for creating the concept to make u s manufacturing noncompetitive he has also threatened to renegotiate the paris climate deal largely seen as the world s best chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change as a businessman however trump seems to take a different approach to climate change privately preparing to protect his investments against climate related problems like sea level rise and coastal erosion according to permit applications reviewed by politico trump has applied to build a wall to prevent coastal erosion at his trump international golf links seaside golf resort in ireland and has explicitly cited risks posed by climate change in his application in a place normally preoccupied with drafting code and dazzling investors suddenly everyone in silicon valley has an opinion about the presidential election and it tends to be the same opinion the innovation economy has a serious distaste for donald trump the masters of this world complain that his ignorance about their work and its relationship to the global economy is horrifying rank and file programmers are quick to call him a clown or worse the unity is notable in an environment where groupthink is frowned upon and nobody ever seems to color inside ideological lines donald trump took to twitter on monday night to defend his donations to veterans charities amid new questions about his january fundraiser the questions center on trump s claims that he donated million to the fundraiser he held instead of attending a republican debate in january at the event he also named other large donations he reportedly solicited for veterans charities but reporters have had a hard time confirming how much money has actually been distributed to veterans groups washington post reporter david fahrenthold noted monday on twitter

to vote in the republican presidential nomination contest several gop leaders tell politico story continued belowrepublican national committee members say thereâ s growing momentum behind an effort to strip nevada of its early place in line â handing it instead to either colorado or arizona â the long knives are out for nevada â said one rnc committeeman â nevada does nothing for us â the review of the stateâ s pecking order is likely to be just one piece of the gopâ s wholesale review of a nominating process that just produced one of the most acrimonious primary seasons in memory and ended with donald trump as the partyâ s nominee the rncâ s rules committee is expected to address the issue when it convenes in july prior to the national convention in cleveland and its recommendations will be passed to a committee of convention delegates that has the ultimate say the early states are the subject of perennial debate among republican leaders who wonder whether theyâ re the best suited to thin the field of presidential contenders texasâ s gop chairman tom mechler and utah rnc committeewoman enid mickelsen proposed in january to eliminate all four early statesâ protected status â and theyâ ve been targeted before typically those debates fade once the presidential nomination process is over â and the presumptive gop nominee generally defends these statesâ hallowed position but nevada a state where trump crushed rivals by more than percentage points is unlikely to escape the axe this time republican leaders argue â they will not tamper with the broader rule â said one national convention delegate and veteran republican leader â but nevada is likely to go bruce hough utahâ s rnc committeeman supports eliminating all early states in favor of a randomized primary calendar but he argued that nevada in particular hasnâ t earned its status â you have to demonstrate that you have a solid political organization which your party is capable of running â he said hough noted that nevadaâ s neighbors came to its aid in to help the state through its caucus woes â it was almost like a shadow party there four years ago â he said â there are a bunch of issues they have to resolve â nevada gop chairman michael mcdonald did not respond to requests for comment but not all nevada gop leaders are planning to go quietly nevadaâ s rnc committeewoman diana orrock said sheâ s open to an early state rotation â but only if it applies to all four regions of the country sheâ d fight any effort to single out nevada for punishment â i will vigorously fight against that because it should be equally applied â she said noting that the state only has six electoral votes orrock added â if we donâ t have early carve out status candidates arenâ t going to bother coming to nevada â not all nevadans are surprised theyâ d be in the partyâ s crosshairs â as much as i would hate to see the caucus stripped from nv given how hard many of us worked to get it the concern is understandable â said peter ernaut a veteran nevada gop strategist whoâ s advised gov brian sandoval and sen john ensign â maybe it s time to take the microphone away until some level of civility returns i am tired of my home state being a public spectacle nevada is better than this â most rnc members contacted declined to be named to avoid antagonizing colleagues in nevada but seven interviewed agreed that momentum is growing to box out nevada from the early state group â they had that embarrassment four years ago when they couldnâ t figure out who won â said one rnc committeeman â as a state they have little credibility with other members â instead rnc members are looking for a state with more strategic value like nevada colorado and arizona feature large latino populations and colorado in particular has become a crucial swing state in the general election though nevada too is considered a swing state its caucuses â locations across counties this year â lend themselves to low turnout and do little to build up the republican party for the fall campaign the rnc officials argued colorado is preparing to vie for the opportunity to supplant nevada â we are absolutely working on the strategy to try to put ourselves in that position â said colorado gop chairman steve house house has pushed state lawmakers to enact legislation establishing a statewide presidential primary which he said rnc members would view favorably the bill is being actively considered by lawmakers but has only cleared early procedural hurdles house said colorado democrats are generally on board as well â if we can turn this into a presidential primary state then we can make a very good case for being the first state in the west â he said hough the utah rnc committeeman said other states should be in the mix too â including his own â if you want to reward republicanism then why not utah that has had a great string of republican governors and dominant state legislatures â he

hours of debate and dozens of amendments the house armed services committee voted to approve its version of the annual national defense authorization act chairman mac thornberry r texas gaveled out the marathon session at a m the bill would authorize billion in defense spending for the new fiscal year even with the topline requested by the administration but it allocates billion in war related overseas contingency operations funds for base budget programs hawkish republicans aim is to eventually get more money through a supplemental appropriation after a new congress and president is sworn in next year a move that has caused heartburn among some armed services democrats the bill is expected to be considered by the full house the week of may hasc ranking democrat adam smith of washington state supported the measure he had said before the markup that he was undecided but cautioned the rearranging of war funding is no small matter the two no votes democrats jackie speier of california and tulsi gabbard of hawaii some highlights from the day and night hasc ok s women registering for the draft in arguably the most surprising vote of the long day the armed services committee narrowly adopted an amendment from rep duncan hunter r calif that would require women to register with selective service hunter didn t even vote for his own amendment which he offered to force public debate on defense secretary ash carter s decision to open all combat jobs to women six other republicans however joined with almost all the panel s democrats to support the proposal lawmakers slug it out on ula spacex the committee adopted by voice vote an amendment from rep mike coffman r colo to permit ula to obtain rd rocket engines for competitive launches the proposal was among the very last considered it s been worked on all day thornberry said ula and pentagon officials say they need rd engines in order to bridge the gap for national security launches before a u s made alternative is developed and certified but opponents led in committee by hunter contended ula is trying to stockpile engines and only nine would be needed at most for competitive launches through hunter said he planned to offer an amendment to cut the number of rockets ula could purchase to nine but the amendment was ruled out of order because the house intelligence committee also has jurisdiction over the issue hasc also adopted an amendment from smith to authorize million to develop a new launch vehicle in addition to a new u s made rd replacement confederate flag amendment unfurled an amendment from smith would have barred the military from supporting military educational institutions and academies that fly the confederate flag smith said the proposal was aimed at the citadel in south carolina which flies the confederate flag but requires a two thirds approval by the state legislature to take it down we need something to force south carolina to do the right thing smith said the panel adopted smith s amendment but only after adding a change from thornberry to exempt institutions like the citadel whose board of visitors has voted to take the flag down effectively rendering the proposal moot republicans charged the proposal would hurt cadets at the citadel which doesn t have the power to remove the flag democratic nuke proposals shot down hasc rejected a slew democratic amendments aimed at the u s nuclear modernization efforts including a proposal from rep loretta sanchez d calif cutting million in nuclear weapons spending the panel also defeated a proposal from rep pete aguilar d calif that would have required a year cost estimate from the congressional budget office for fielding and maintaining the nation s nuclear stockpile as well as life extension modernization and replacement programs sage grouse limitations stick the committee turned back an effort from rep niki tsongas d mass to strip provisions that prohibit findings under the endangered species act for the greater sage grouse the vote was against removing the limits morning d though bubble would it really be ndaa if rep speier didn t have a sage grouse poster handy gitmo proposal defeated the panel once again defeated an amendment from smith to roll back limitations on closing the u s military prison at guantanamo bay cuba and transferring the detainees to the u s smith who conceded the proposal was familiar to lawmakers again called the prison an eyesore that is unbelievably expensive more markup action the panel adopted a proposal from rep john kline r minn that would exempt the defense department and the national nuclear security administration from an executive order requiring prospective contractors to disclose labor law violations to the government and lawmakers turned back an amendment from gabbard to strike a provision to reauthorize the training and equipping of syrian rebels earlier hasc defeated a proposal from rep tammy duckworth d ill to separate the f program s next

late watch donald trump s foreign policy speech fails to impress writes our colleague michael crowley in his address to an elite invitation only washington foreign policy audience wednesday donald trump promised that as president he would restore a coherent vision to america s role in the world but across the ideological spectrum and even among natural allies trump s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that trump is up to the job trump s slogan america first more here from politico s ben schreckinger and nick gass donald trump went for full on presidential on wednesday laying out a broad foreign policy vision in prepared remarks delivered from a ritzy hotel ballroom the speech was notable more for the atmospherics and presentation than for its substance which amounted to an elaborated form of the foreign policy points trump has been making in stump speeches and interviews in some cases for decades with an eye towards november trump aimed his critiques squarely at barack obama and hillary clinton he explicitly called for a nonpartisan american foreign policy and positioned himself at times as a dove to clinton s hawk setting the stage for a general election foreign policy debate in which trump scrambles typical partisan divides straying selectively from republican party orthodoxy corker gushes over speech via our colleague hanna trudo senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker praised donald trump s foreign policy speech on wednesday night calling it a great step in the right direction speaking to msnbc host chris matthews on his program hardball the tennessee republican said that trump s remarks delivered at washington s mayflower hotel earlier in the day were full of substance and he was very pleased with what he heard and graham pans it via politico s brianna gurciullo lindsey graham tore into donald trump s speech on foreign policy calling

"2016-05-13 10:27","POLITICO's Morning Money: Trump takes on Amazon â€” Cam Fine defended â€” Judge Collyer strikes again â€” Inside the Trump/Ryan summit","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edttrump takes on amazon forgive us for turning the top of this column into the trump files over the last few days we promise it won t be forever but it s hard to ignore some of the more outlandish stuff the presumptive gop nominee and his campaign advisers are saying in the realm of finance and the economy on thursday night on fox news hannity show trump went after jeff bezos and amazon following reports that the washington post owned by bezos is deploying reporters to vet every aspect of trump s life i mean imagine that a major newspaper reporting on a would be president the outrage in any event trump s comments the washington post is owned as a toy by jeff bezos who controls amazon amazon is getting away with murder tax wise he s using the washington post for power so that the politicians in washington don t tax amazon like they should be taxed h e s got a huge antitrust problem because he s controlling so much what they ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and he s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people and i ll tell you what we can t let him get away with it i just heard they re taking these really bad stories i mean they re wrong i wouldn t even say bad they re wrong and in many cases they have no proper information and they re putting them together they re slopping them together and they re going to do a book and the book is going to be all false stuff up because the stories are so wrong and the reporters i mean one after another so what they re doing is he s using that as a political instrument to try and stop antitrust the facts amazon is not getting away with murder on taxes it now collects sales taxes in many states and it has lobbied in favor of an internet sales tax the company does face anti trust claims but it s under no immediate threat but all of that hardly matters the post is doing what the post has always done see gate water as is every other serious news organization trump appears to think that aggressive reporting is something that needs to be stopped this is the kind of rhetoric more associated with a former president taken down by the post cam fine defended better markets dennis kelleher responding to thursday s item complaining about fine s criticism of jamie dimon the anonymous former senior hill staffer attack on icba pres cam fine is baseless community banks would benefit from targeted reg relief and ending the unfair competition from wall street s tbtf banks he merely called out those tbtf banks for relentlessly using community banks as a trojan horse behind which they hide dangerous deregulation provisions for themselves which also enable them to compete unfairly there are easily votes in the senate today for genuine community bank relief and the only reason it hasn t passed is because of the unrelated provisions inserted for the benefit of the tbtf banks fine fighting this hostage taking by the tbtf banks is exactly what he should be doing judge collyer strikes again a former administration official emails on the latest obamacare ruling it is amazing to see the two biggest legislative accomplishments of the obama presidency under attack from a single judge given collyer s previous rulings on fsoc s designation of metlife and insulating jpm from wamu liabilities it is not surprising that she has taken up conservatives cause again as she continues to rule against major reforms the credibility of each decision is diminished those who hoped the metlife ruling was a sea change on the merits of dodd frank are instead left with a single judge on a mission it has to hurt the chances of the decision standing on appeal and how ironic is it that conservatives who loathe activist judges are left defending collyer s judicial agenda inside the trump ryan summit politico s jake sherman and john bresnahan the rapprochement between the gop s presumed standard bearer and its top elected official assuming that s what this is is clearly a work in progress the two are on separate planets ideologically and temperamentally and one much hyped morning summit was never going to produce some magical mindmeld but now after a get together that was described by sources as pleasant productive even interesting trump and ryan are waltzing toward unity or something approaching it trump trade could slam the poor politico s doug palmer donald trump s plan to get tough with china japan and mexico could cost the average u s household more than a year if carried to its logical extreme with the burden falling hardest on the lowest income households according to a new report from the national foundation for american policy we find that a trump tariff proposal against all countries would cost u s consumers billion annually and trillion over five years david tuerck and paul bachman a pair of economists at suffolk university in boston write in the report our

state conventionanchorage alaska tonight dnc chair rep debbie wasserman schultz addressed the alaska state convention below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery as chair of the dnc i ve committed myself to getting to know my fellow democrats with visits to all fifty states and i ll be honest it s been a little easier to reach those lower forty eight but i know i m not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distance to be at the convention i understand there are even as many as high school students coming all the way from juneau and who registered to be delegates let s give them a hand for being the future of our party and let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our country s largest state to show your support your enthusiasm energy your commitment and your dedication to our party will make all the difference on election day so we ve taken the state strategy that howard dean pioneered when he was chair of the national party and we ve gone even further providing more funding more infrastructure more rocket fuel to keep the engines of our state parties firing on all cylinders and holding republicans in office and in elections accountable that means that here in alaska the dnc helps fund direct mail campaigns to reach voters and help get them to the polls on election day we fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships in fact kay brown can tell you she was one of the first state party partnership employees we ever hired since the dnc has directly provided the alaska democratic party more than in direct support but it s not just the funding the dnc has been out pacing the gop in how we offer direct support to our state parties with training and bench building we share our deep research and communications capabilities in alaska and across the country since we have quintupled the size of our digital team to boost fundraising and provide training and support to our state parties we ve organized a team of experts in messaging branding and polling to review the way we communicate and we ve built an in house communications team to hold republicans accountable every single day we ve built out a state of the art media monitoring operation to track and inform our rapid response operation our teams are providing training disseminating best practices sharing technology and design assets and building community among state party staff and the rest of the democratic family and combined with our national state of the art voter file which we ve been building out for years we have a real edge that s going to help carry us to victory and we ve done it all while paying off more than million in debt after winning the presidential election and re electing barack obama but of course our number one advantage comes from our candidates and the contrast they re offering alaska voters and the american people i couldn t be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket from day one bernie sanders and hillary clinton have been running smart substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter we ve watched them engage honestly with voters answer thoughtfully at town halls and debates and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to the hopes and dreams of the american people and no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee we will be united coming out of our convention and headed toward election day in the words of barack obama hillary clinton and bernie sanders trump will not be president at the dnc we are not going to make the same mistake his republican opponents made we re ready for trump ready to hold him accountable for the damage he s doing as a candidate and the damage he s promising he would do as president just this week trump met with paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to show that despite their nasty mud slinging primary they re getting ready to sing kumbaya and give us everything they ve got and what they ve got is the same old playbook the same failed trickle down economic policies that preceded the great recession under the last republican president so trump isn t something new he s just the old republican brand but with a little extra bronzer on he s that much move dangerous he only looks out for himself he lacks the temperament and judgment to be commander in chief and every aspect of his presidency would harm our country and damage our standing in the world even as a candidate trump has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would make america less safe he has no foreign policy experience but don t worry about that he said he ll rely on his good brain instead of listening to experts he has a decades long record of denigrating women which is why seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy he exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric he s making our communities less safe and he s only a candidate and while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success his record is riddled with examples that he prefers to turn a quick buck even when it comes at the expense of workers but much of this the same old playbook gave george w bush two terms so we have to treat trump s candidacy as a real threat because it is i m inspired here tonight i wish everyone could see how much dedication the democrats of alaska have don t believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint alaska red and say it isn t a battleground state means you re sidelined in every presidential election since the percentage of alaskans casting their vote for the democrat has increased from in to more than in this has already been an exciting election year nationally working together i know we can dump trump and eventually turn alaska blue i know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election so thank you for all you ve done to support our party and thank you for everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in november now on to victory thank you alaska democrats "

"2016-04-28 15:03","Dangerous Donaldâ€™s Foreign Policy â€œPlanâ€","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org","as heâ s done throughout his campaign dangerous donald trump is proving that on foreign policy he lacks the judgment experience and temperament to be our next commander in chief trump would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reckless disregard with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our national security and make the american people less safe donâ t take our word for it see what people are saying about his remarks below a trump first foreign policyhis maiden policy speech on wednesday devoted to foreign affairs earns an â incompleteâ at trump university â the word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards if not his own the central motif like all of mr trumpâ s political thought is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem and everybody else is a pathetic loser so trust his instincts and temperament â for prepared remarks or for that matter even an after dinner talk mr trumpâ s speech was especially rife with contradictions he said the conduct of foreign policy must be â more unpredictable we are totally predictable we tell everything â he also said the conduct of foreign policy must be â disciplined deliberate and consistent â â mr trump isnâ t known for close readings of his briefing books if such documents exist and deep policy knowledge is obviously not the source of his political appeal but americans typically prefer presidents who are conversant about the worldâ s biggest problems beyond a sound bite or twoâ mr trump promised to â win our new future struggles which may be many which may be complex but we will win if i become president â he wonâ t become the gop nominee much less president if voters donâ t trust him with nuclear weaponsâ donald trumpâ s strange worldview no oneâ s fears are likely to be allayed by this speech which was clearly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter it did not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world understanding of the balance or exercise of power or even a careful reading of history mr trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods often based on wrong assumptions heâ s been refuted before on his claim that the islamic state is making â millions of dollars a weekâ by selling libyan oil there is zero evidence of that the nuclear deal with the united states and other major powers has not made iran a â great power â nor has tehran violated the conditions of that pact as mr trump has said mr trump says he knows how to negotiate and to him that seems to mean putting forward maximal positions that he can then walk back that wonâ t work in foreign policy mr trump did not display any willingness to learn or to correct his past errors for someone who claims he is ready to lead the free world that is inexcusable trump s unreal foreign policy our viewas anyone who watches reality television knows the genre might be entertaining but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous which is a good place to start with the much awaited foreign policy speech delivered wednesday in washington by presidential candidate donald trump as with the apprentice the show that helped him become a household name the republican front runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain class of people in this case the primary audience was voters opposed to trade resentful of immigrants distrustful of foreign governments and wistful for a time when america wielded more power in a simpler world in reaching out to this group trump vividly portrayed a world that does not exist americaâ s allies would be more respectful after being lectured to while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster china would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure and troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through u s disengagement â things might happen that way on tv but not in reality or perhaps we should say real reality the sacramento bee the editorial boardthen he gave a rambling vague and incoherent speech wednesday full of platitudes and contradictions and suggested he would undermine international alliances that have helped keep america safe since world war ii it was billed as a major foreign policy address but voters looking for reassurances about trump as commander in chief canâ t feel that much more comfortable our longtime allies certainly wonâ t be confident washington post anne applebaumif you werenâ t already convinced that parody is now the central art form of our era then donald trumpâ s grand foreign policy speech yesterday was the proof â the multiple inconsistencies and internal contradictions have already been listed by others on the one hand he said that â your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them â on the other hand he threatened to â walkâ if those same friends didnâ t pony up to his demands he wants to invest heavily in the military but he wants to stop using the military he doesnâ t want to do â nation buildingâ but does want to promote â regional stability â there was no sense that he knew what either of those terms actually meant â anyone who sits down and analyzes the speech from start to finish will of course worry about the contradictions the inconsistencies the impossible claims the detachment from reality from donald trump a foreign policy speech heavy on slogans and light on detailsthose expecting a coherent well ordered view of the world and a strategy to match it would have been disappointed listening to donald trumpâ s foreign policy address on wednesday the speech was a collection of bromides slogans aims and promises wrapped in mr trumpâ s conviction that he can solve americaâ s problems in a cruel and unforgiving worldâ all without specifying how â nobody expected great detail on how exactly he would accomplish all of his plans but in what was billed as a major foreign policy address the absence of guidance on how he would achieve his goals was striking the best he could do about better burden sharing with our nato allies was to suggest a summit to discuss the matter â his implication that only he knows how to fix what ails the republic suggests a self absorption that goes well beyond the normal ego and narcissism required to run for president mr trumpâ s preference for celebrity his over substance and his reliance on one liners over serious analysis of complicated problems point up potential for conflict at minimum should he win the nationâ s most demanding job a position that requires prudence curiosity and a willingness not only to ask questions but also to home in on the right ones associated press lolita c baldor and sagar meghanidonald trump strained to lay out a clear vision of his america first foreign policy on wednesday vowing to substitute hard headed realism for what he called a post cold war era replete with u s national security failures yet the republican presidential front runner outlined no strategy for how he d make the united states at the same time a consistent and unpredictable force in the world and he didn t appear to allay the concerns of u s and international critics â republicans at home as well as democrats â who see him as unfit for the responsibilities of commander in chief â trump also contradicted his own broad brush approach to foreign policy he said at one point that the best way to achieve his goals was through disciplined deliberate and consistent policy later however he exhorted the nation to be more unpredictable in how it combats enemies graham tears into trumpâ s â patheticâ foreign policy speechsen lindsey graham r s c tore into donald trumpâ s foreign policy address wednesday in a series of tweets saying â ronald reagan must be rolling over in his grave â the outspoken senator called trumpâ s speech at the mayflower hotel in washington pathetic and incoherent â trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role america plays in the world how to win war on terror and threats we face â graham

that term differs sharply from donald trump s vision of a smiling speaker at his side mouth shut and domesticated just like chris christie ryan who made peace with trump earlier this month yet remains

regular order pandora s box how bad does speaker ryan really want regular order we re about to find out the house is about to dive deep into appropriations season traditionally run under an open amendment process democrats are salivating at the change to put conservatives on record on sensitive social issues that can make them look bad they already are as we saw with last week s lgbt

in the next month or so the government s top infectious disease expert said sunday as officials race to prevent a widespread outbreak of the virus that is believed linked to birth defects anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said on abc that more than americans already have the zika virus all those cases are travel related but the landscape will change soon dr fauci said as infected mosquitoes enter the u s mainland pressure s on both chambers have passed their own zika bills but they ve got a bunch of differences to reconcile and the path forward is uncertain the house s million package is paid for at conservatives request the senate s billion not so much numerous house republicans however have told your huddle author they re concerned about being labeled the bad guy for not providing enough money particularly should the virus start to spread in the u s at greater rates so the marker for the house already seems to be moving toward

thornberry r texas last week dodged this issue at the last minute in the rules committee stripping from the national defense authorization act language about having women sign up for the draft because of budgetary reason clever but hill republicans like thornberry who hate this issue and were ticked that rep duncan hunter tucked it into ndaa via gotcha amendment during the panel markup aren t up for air on this debate yet the hill s jordain carney notes that the senate is taking up this question in its own ndaa draft and supporters have one big r behind their pitch mitch the senate armed services committee has already included a requirement to open the draft to women in its version of the ndaa a move that sparked outrage from conservatives s upporters got an unexpected boost as they fight to keep the language in the bill majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said he supports the change while noting he doesn t expect the united states to return to the draft given where we are today

today","morningdefense@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by jeremy herb am edtwith louis nelson and connor o brienbreaking overnight i obama lifts u s arms embargo with vietnam the new york times reports from hanoi president obama said at a news conference on monday in the vietnamese capital that the united states had agreed to lift completely its embargo on lethal weapons sales the united states is fully lifting the ban on the sale of military equipment to vietnam that has been in place for some years mr obama said vietnam had long asked for the embargo to be revoked the decision which comes more than years after the end of the vietnam war in involved weighing vietnam s human rights record against the country s need to defend itself against an increasing threat from china its neighbor breaking overnight ii obama confirms taliban leader s death via the associated press president barack obama said monday that the violent death of taliban leader mullah mohammed akhtar mansour by a u s airstrike should send a clear signal to anti american extremists that we re going to protect our people obama also said mansour s death was an important milestone in the yearslong effort to bring peace to afghanistan it has been confirmed that he is dead obama said monday during his first visit to vietnam he is an individual who as head of the taliban was specifically targeting u s personnel and troops inside of afghanistan who obama sent there to help counter terrorism and help train afghan troops mansour was killed when a u s drone fired on his vehicle in the southwestern pakistan province of baluchistan though it was unclear whether the airstrike took place on friday or saturday with strike u s takes war back to pakistan writes the washington post the u s drone strike that killed taliban chief akhtar mohammad mansour represents another escalation in u s involvement in the war in afghanistan by trying to cripple an insurgent group that has for years found refuge on pakistani soil the strike early saturday marks the most aggressive u s military action in pakistan since the raid that killed osama bin laden but unlike the bin laden raid which prompted outrage in pakistan the reported strike on mansour provoked a fairly muted reaction sunday from pakistani government and military leaders even as afghan officials cheered and described the attack as proof of the afghan taliban s deep presence in pakistan while further investigations are being carried out pakistan wishes to once again state that the drone attack was a violation of its sovereignty the country s foreign ministry said in a statement adding that it was unable to confirm whether mansour had been killed the view from afghanistan mansour s death greeted as hopeful sign reports the ap the killing of afghan taliban leader mullah mohammed akhtar mansour in a u s drone strike was greeted sunday by kabul s political leadership as a game changer in efforts to end the long insurgent war plaguing afghanistan in a rare show of unity president ashraf ghani and chief executive abdullah abdullah both welcomed the news of mansour s death as the removal of a man who unleashed violence against innocent civilians in afghanistan and was widely regarded as an obstacle to peace within the militant group war report iraqi forces begin assault on fallujah reports the wall street journal iraqi forces have begun their assault on islamic state in fallujah prime minister haider al abadi said late sunday an operation that aims to evict the extremists from one of their last major territorial holdings in iraq the moment of real victory has come and daesh has no option but to flee mr abadi told state tv using an arabic acronym for the sunni extremist group the operation follows months of planning and preparation in coordination with a u s led military coalition that is backing iraqi forces with airstrikes happy monday and welcome to morning defense where we think this busy morning is

joint seapower and readiness hearing now scheduled to take place thursday on capitol hill instead of aboard the aircraft carrier uss dwight d eisenhower while pierside at naval station norfolk va the hearing was organized by rep randy forbes the seapower subcommittee chairman who is running for reelection in a new district after the courts redrew virginia s congressional districts last year it would have been co chaired by his fellow virginia republican readiness subcommittee chairman rob wittman who plans to run for governor next year driving the week on capitol hill senate defense action the senate plans to consider the national defense authorization act on the floor this week which will provide a better sense of the direction of the final bill on several contentious issues one of the key fights will be over how much funding is authorized by the bill itself as senate armed services chairman john mccain r ariz said last week he plans to offer an amendment to authorize an additional billion which would closely follow the house ndaa he makes his case in a dear colleague letter here mccain will also be at the center of two potential fights on the bill requiring women to register for the draft and russian rocket engines and if that wasn t enough the senate defense appropriations subcommittee will mark up its spending bill on tuesday and the full committee could take it up thursday driving the week overseas obama in asia as we saw this morning obama will be making news while the u s is sleeping all week during his asia trip that will take him to vietnam and japan the trip includes a visit to hiroshima a stop that our colleague edward isaac dovere writes is part of obama s penchant for confronting complicated truths about the past he s not sorry seven years after kicking off his presidency with a famous outreach to the arab world speech in cairo skipping israel barack obama is about to bookend it with one of his last big trips on air force one landing first here in vietnam and then on to hiroshima obama s critics call stops like this an apology tour he and his white house aides call it reckoning with history some prefer coming to grips with history these trips are deliberate ordered up by a president whose foreign policy has been shaped by a sense of himself as a catalyst forcing the world to deal with the past in order to deal with the future according to current and former officials close to the president battle of the bands lawmakers scrutinize the military s music budget our colleague ellen mitchell reports live music in the military has become a nearly half billion dollar a year road show but even some of the pentagon s top supporters in congress say it s time to cut the volume from their humble origins in the american revolution s fife and drum corps the u s military s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least bands some of whose members are outfitted with flutes and tubas that has placed them in the crosshairs of lawmakers who say it makes no sense to lavish this kind of money on music when the pentagon is scaling back combat troops entertainment is just not the role of the military said rep martha mcsally a hawkish arizona republican and retired air force colonel who serves on the armed services committee top u s commander makes secret visit to syria ap s robert burns

have responsibility for the people that we put here army gen joseph votel said in an interview as dusk fell on the remote outpost where he had arrived hours earlier kudos to votel the new u s central

"2016-05-09 13:53","ICYMI: DNC Chair Op-Ed: Why Democrats Are Suing Arizona Over Its Election","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org","rep debbie wasserman the arizona republicitâ s certainly no accident that so many of the long waiting lines to vote in the march primary election occurred in maricopa county which is home to a large minority population the state closed percent of its polling locations citing â cost cuttingâ as the reason but this is far more serious than a careless oversight or a bureaucratic mix up arizona is a state where conservatives banned bilingual education in where sheriff joe arpaio has run roughshod over the rights of hispanics with illegal traffic stop detentions and where hispanic african american and native american voters have long faced undue burdens in exercising their most basic rights as citizens the issue isnâ t just that voting locations were severely cut back many polling locations have been moved or changed causing more unnecessary confusion in fact almost half of all maricopa county polling locations changed between and and election officials actually have more changes planned before election day in november these republican laws and changes disproportionately burden students and young people who are more likely to move within a district and those dependent on public transportation and the elderly who are more likely to need assistance voting by mail this is part of a much broader deliberate and concerted effort by republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters who are inconvenient to them on election day and those voters are more vulnerable today than they have been in the past when the supreme court decided a case called shelby v holder three years ago it gutted a key provision of the voting rights act that has protected voters since the height of the civil rights movement before the shelby decision arizona was considered a â covered jurisdiction â which meant that the department of justice would review any changes to voting rules there to protect against precisely the type of irregularities voters faced last month but since the supreme court poked a major hole in the voting rights act republicans have used the opportunity to attack voting rights among groups who traditionally do not vote for republicans in those previously covered jurisdictions if no one steps in now maricopa county would become one of their greatest disenfranchisement success stories this is completely wrong and itâ s why this lawsuit is absolutely necessary when teacher luz magallanes arrived at her polling place to vote in the arizona primary before work she hoped to share her voting story with her students later that day but looking at the long lines she decided to go to work and vote in the evening instead when she returned she had to wait in line for nearly five hours before finally casting her ballot when leslie feldman arrived at her polling location with her two young daughters she didnâ t expect an ordeal in the course of waiting for nearly five hours she found the voting centerâ s one working bathroom was overwhelmed and leaking raw sewage onto the sidewalk when she finally reached the front of the voting line she was told they had run out of democratic ballots and when new ballots finally arrived and she cast her vote she passed hundreds of people still waiting if successful the lawsuit will restore federal election oversight of maricopa county and make it easier for voters to vote in locations near their homes or workplaces it would also reverse a new arizona state law that made it a felony for absentee voters to have signed and sealed ballots turned in for them rather than having to mail them in â a practice used widely among minority groups to vote early so this case isn t just about responding to what happened in march â this case is about the future itâ s about restoring election protections long needed and relied upon by arizonans in time for the general election democrats believe our country is stronger when every voice is heard and every vote is counted and we will keep fighting to make sure the sacred right of every american to vote is protected itâ s impossible to know how many people didnâ t vote because they couldnâ t spend the long hours waiting in line but it is possible to make sure long lines convoluted rules and unnecessary barriers to the ballot become a thing of the past thatâ s what this lawsuit is about every voter deserves a voice every election matters and when a state passes laws that make it unduly difficult to cast a ballot that state is out of step with american values the law and the constitution as democrats weâ re sending a clear signal that we will not stand for it rep debbie wasserman schultz d florida is chairwoman of the democratic national committee "

millions of dollars to counter senator bernie sanders of vermont in states that are unlikely to be general election battlegrounds delaying any pivot to the general election and shrinking her potential financial advantage over the eventual republican nominee while mrs clinton has built a significant advantage in pledged delegates over mr sanders in the democratic nominating contest her lead has come at a significant cost she spent more than she raised in each of the first three months of the year according to federal election commission data including more than million on ads in march alone according to the campaign media analysis group mrs clinton has spent at least million on advertising in states like new york illinois and massachusetts money that could otherwise have been saved for the general election bernie sandersfor bernie sanders slow and steady wins the fundraising race the vermont senator began his bid for the democratic presidential nomination last year with a sizable financial disadvantage compared to front runner hillary clinton by the end of last june sanders had raised just shy of million for his campaign less than a third of the million clinton had raised for hers but the sanders campaign slowly and steadily eroded the former secretary of state s fundraising advantage sanders slightly edged clinton in contributions in s fourth quarter but his fundraising operation didn t kick into high gear until his campaign has outraised clinton s every month this year by at least in march alone bernie received million in contributions compared to million for hillary for america now sanders and clinton are essentially even in total campaign contributions with each campaign bringing in more than million for their bids by the end of march with the primary campaign entering its final weeks both campaigns are spending at a frenetic pace the clinton campaign spent in march more than it raised in contributions with a so called burn rate of sanders had a burn rate of for march for the campaign to date the sanders campaign has spent of the money it raised compared to for the clinton campaign republican party candidatested cruzdonald j trump says the abstruse republican delegate system distorts the will of the people senator ted cruz says the party s nominating rules have been in place from the beginning mr cruz is right and he may be losing the public argument anyway with polls showing a strong preference for nominating the candidate with the most popular votes even if he fails to secure a majority of delegates before the convention in july mr cruz has brushed up this week against an uncomfortable reality his only road to victory is a messy one as he slogs through a merciless stretch of the primary calendar straining to pick off delegates from northeastern voters who seem disinclined to embrace his hard line conservatism mr cruz of texas has appeared increasingly frustrated amid questions about his path john kasichrepublican presidential hopeful john kasich stands out from his opponents with a unique set of out of this world endorsements a trio of astronauts who have thrown their support behind his white house candidacy the endorsements were not any part of a concerted effort to nab backing from the space community the ohio governor has not even articulated any policy on space but instead came about from personal connections and individual political leanings kasich s campaign told abc news steve oswald who piloted two missions on the space shuttle discovery in the early s said his backing last month came about when his wife former u s rep mary bono r california announced her own endorsement of kasich she basically says he s always been a solid citizen oswald told abc news donald trumpelton john and his longtime boyfriend david furnish entered a civil partnership on dec in england under a law the country had just enacted granting recognition to same sex couples the congratulations poured in as the two men appeared at a joyous ceremony at windsor guildhall amid a crush of paparazzi donald j trump who had known the couple for years took to his blog to express his excitement i know both of them and they get along wonderfully it s a marriage that s going to work mr trump wrote adding i m very happy for them if two people dig each other they dig each other mr trump is now the leading candidate for president in the republican primary which has traditionally been dominated by hopefuls eager to show how deeply conservative they are on social issues like gay rights and marriage but mr trump is far more accepting of sexual minorities than his party s leaders have been on thursday he startled some republicans by saying on nbc s today show that he opposed a recently passed north carolina law that prohibits people from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to the gender they were born with striking down a charlotte ordinance transgender people should use the bathroom they feel is

"2016-05-16 07:21","Trump backers face 'scam PAC' charges","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," trump backers face scam pac chargesby isaac arnsdorf and kenneth p vogel am edt as donald trump rushes to start collecting the billion expected to be necessary to compete for the white house one of his biggest challenges may come from those claiming to support him an increasing number of unauthorized groups are invoking the presumptive gop nominee s name to raise money suggesting that they ll use the cash to support his campaign even as some appear to be spending most of their money on contracts with favored consultants trump s campaign and its allies worry that the groups are doing little to help the campaign and may be doing more harm than good by siphoning off cash that would otherwise go to the campaign s fledgling fundraising effort the campaign has disavowed several of the groups demanding they stop using the candidate s name in fundraising appeals and calling at least one super pac founded by a trump adviser a big league scam but appeals keep coming from other groups with more now joining the scrum and rival groups accusing one other of being scams legal changes and technological developments have paved the way for an explosion of political non profit groups including super pacs which have rushed to raise money with very little oversight about how they spend it leading to charges and counter charges of profiteering while conservative operatives in recent years have worried that a surge in so called scam pacs has become a scourge on their efforts the threat they pose to trump is especially acute the billionaire real estate showman mostly self funded his primary campaign boasting that unlike his competitors he wasn t dependent on donors and mostly eschewing efforts to create a fundraising operation as such his supporters many of whom are new to political giving and not well versed in election law or attuned to the fine print of political solicitations may be uniquely susceptible to fundraising appeals from unauthorized groups run by operatives with spotty reputations more than two dozen unauthorized groups have formed claiming to support trump and they ve raised a total of million this cycle according to the most recent federal election commission filings but only six of the groups have actually bought ads supporting trump the sheer number of groups raising money using trump s name can make it difficult for even savvy donors to determine which groups legit and could freeze any potential big givers the las vegas casino mogul sheldon adelson a leading gop mega donor who last week officially endorsed trump intends to spend heavily to help elect him but his advisers are skeptical of the crop of the pro trump pacs according to an operative familiar with their thinking they re not comfortable with a lot of the options out there supporting trump said the operative they re going to be very careful the trump campaign hasn t done itself any favors by neglecting some basic steps that could help marginalize posers and imitators for example the campaign hasn t bought google ads for the candidate s name directing searchers to his official campaign website thus it can be hard for online contributors to distinguish among the groups touting support for trump an outfit called restore american freedom and liberty has blasted out emails trumpeting the latest polls showing trump tying hillary clinton ending with a big red contribute button according to its campaign finance disclosures the group has raised more than but spent just on ads split between ted cruz and ben carson most of the money went to a new york company called amagi strategies for what the disclosures said was fundraising management and research amagi strategies is also the main beneficiary of other unauthorized pacs the group s treasurer denver lawyer alexander hornaday and amagi ceo tyler whitney didn t answer requests for comment there s an emerging rivalry between two super pacs jockeying to position themselves as the legitimate unlimited money vehicles for trump like priorities usa action is for hillary clinton and right to rise was for jeb bush but both have to differentiate themselves from fringe groups and win donors confidence the newer one called the committed for american sovereignty is run by doug watts who used to work on the ben carson campaign watts said the group would focus on major donors instead of online contributions and will commit to spending cents of every dollar on contacting voters some of these groups in a bald faced way go out and rape and pillage and are more than disingenuous with the people that they re soliciting for funds otherwise known as scam pacs watts said trump people are particularly vulnerable in that they ve been sitting on their hands watts brushed off as irrelevant that the group s california chair former state senator tony strickland faces a fine for allegedly disguising campaign contributions the super pac that has spent the most money to help trump so far is the great america pac led by eric beach who worked for rand paul s presidential campaign and former reagan campaign manager ed rollins in another sign that donors have trouble distinguishing among the groups the great america pac received more than donations intended for the trump campaign itself and forwarded them to the campaign the pac has spent more than million so far on pro trump ads but raised eyebrows with a tv spot that looked unprofessional and asked supporters to call a number to donate one of its strategists jesse benton was convicted this month for buying an endorsement for ron paul in and amy kremer a tea party activist who was an early leader of the group quit this month over a disagreement with beach there s been a great advantage for us in that trump wasn t actively soliciting funds and because of that we were able to capture the trump supporters who were very enthusiastic beach said of course there s going to be scammers but we feel we re the sole outside organization that s been around and that is the most credible the pac s treasurer is dan backer whose consulting firm db capitol strategies has been paid more than backer is also the treasurer of pacs such as conservative action fund and tea party forward that have spent more on their own operating expenses than on their stated causes backer said that s a misinterpretation based on how fec reports are organized as for great america pac he said it s probably the best most effective steward of donor funds this pac does stuff whereas nobody else does longtime trump ally roger stone has warned donors to beware of great america pac branding it a scam stone has his own super pac the committee to restore america s greatness which trump s campaign manager corey lewandowski blasted as a big league scam separately stone says he raised to organize a protest called stop the steal against the all out bid to deprive donald trump of victory at a contested convention in cleveland now that trump s rivals have cleared the field stone told politico every penny will be spent on what is now an america first unity rally the effort s website says contributions will not be used in connection with federal elections but nominating conventions qualify as elections under federal law according to paul ryan an attorney at the campaign legal center the group would have to register with the federal election commission and file disclosure reports i ve never before seen anything like this ryan said stop the steal shares a santa ana calif address with stone s super pac the committee to restore america s greatness fec reports show the group has raised it s unclear if any of the expenses benefited trump s candidacy the first super pac supporting trump colorado based republican operative mike ciletti s make america great again pac shut down last fall after the candidate disavowed it it raised million but hasn t made any apparent pro trump expenditures to view online "

illinois there s a new power struggle shaping up in city hall this time it s over the city s two airports and the thousands of contracts worth billions of dollars that flow through them on the state side there s big political news with democratic rep jack franks announcing on sunday that he will not seek a new term in the statehouse instead franks is moving toward a mchenry county board bid this is significant because franks represents a frequent no vote on the democratic side in the house including on budgets his party has put forward in an interview with illinois playbook on sunday franks said one benefit of his moving out of the way the so called democratic supermajority would reveal itself to be false franks has managed to win in a strongly held gop district so there s a stronger chance for republicans to reclaim that seat the quote it s a lonely voice screaming in the wind at this point franks on trying to stick it through in springfield how it works franks said democrats have until august to put a new name on the ballot franks vowed not to take part in any ploy that would involve his stepping down early before the election so the party could give someone a leg up he also ruled out protecting the seat winning then stepping down after he s reelected why county chair then maybe i can actually get something done for the people in springfield i don t think the dynamic is going to change for quite some time i ve never seen it so bad here s an opportunity where people in mchenry county in leadership being an executive i can implement a lot of changes that can help

warner said in a joint statement and president barack obama used the occasion as an opportunity to kvetch about infrastructure underfunding from congress the d c metro historically has been a great strength of this region he said when asked by a reporter about wmata s issues but it is just one more example of the under investments that have been made more on his comments below ripping off the band aid expect to hear more from general manager paul wiedefeld today when he appears on wamu s kojo nnamdi show to talk about the shutdowns more generally his faster is better attitude reflects a shift from transportation and infrastructure administrators around the country toward quicker cheaper approaches to conducting significant maintenance projects rather than attempting to minimize impacts on commuters by dragging out the project timeline it happened in boston three years ago when transportation officials close to completely shutter the major artery running through callahan tunnel and fix it up in three months rather than try to do partial closures for months and new york is considering a similar prospect now as it mulls whether to completely close the l train between manhattan and brooklyn for a year and a half or allow for partial service that provides one fifth of current capacity for three years get ready for shared pain draft plan says the draft plan which wiedefeld is hoping to get approved in the next week involves a detailed schedule of short term shutdowns and periods of single tracking that focus largely on the above ground portions of the system that lie further from the center of d c that strategy is meant to allow for staff to maximize time on nights and weekends to tackle maintenance on underground in the heart of the system wiedefeld also plans to curtail late night service between midnight and a m on weekends and to start maintenance at p m on weeknights under the plan lauren writes the agency will finish the installation of ntsb recommended boots and seals on all third rail cables by the end of the summer while all underground boots will be retrofitted by the end of may on fta versus fra it s a done deal norton says after months of waffling on the issue d c del eleanor holmes norton came out with a definitive statement on friday that she is supporting the decision to keep the federal transit administration as the agency appointed to oversee safety improvements on the system despite vehement opposition raised by the national transportation safety board raised last week congress through map and the fast act authorized fta to assume direct safety oversight of a transit system if the state safety oversight agency is unable to do so norton wrote thus fta has a mandate from congress and as a practical matter is the only actor capable of quickly taking on safety oversight of wmata she also called for regional officials to make haste in drafting legislation that would establish an independent safety oversight authority and urged congress to stand ready to pass such a law in the fall it s monday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all

future friday the bipartisan policy center holds a discussion on modernizing our air traffic control system what s the holdup with paul rinaldi president of the national air traffic controllers association and charles barclay former president and ceo of the american associations of airport executives skip to the front of the line it seems likely that the senate will abandon its work on the energy amp water appropriations bill deeming the whole iranian heavy water kerfuffle a wash at least for now and moving on to a combo package of the transportation housing and urban development and military construction veterans affairs appropriations bills this week according to politico s approps aces ben weyl and matthew nussbaum obama lambasts gop on transpo building on his wmata comments president obama pulled no punches on friday taking republicans to the woodshed and accusing the gop of actually standing in the way of goodhearted attempts by his administration to fix america s crumbling infrastructure from the commander in chief we ve got bridges we ve got roads we have ports we have airports we have water mains and pipes as we saw in flint that suffer from neglect and the reason we ve been neglecting them is not because we don t know how to fix them obama told reporters during a friday afternoon press conference so who s to blame the problem we have is that the republican congress has been resistant to really taking on this problem in a serious way and the reason is because of an ideology that says government spending is necessarily bad obama continued how quickly we forget but while obama was sure to pat himself on the back for white house work done to advance infrastructure funding the president seems to have a limited memory for years the administration didn t even put forth a highway and transit proposal of its own much to the dismay of lawmakers much less concrete funding ideas for digging the highway trust fund out of its hole remember the white house plan to fund infrastructure using overseas war savings a smoke and mirrors accounting gimmick with no ties to transportation we re not done yet and that doesn t even touch on the fact that the white house shut down attempts by the late rep jim oberstar then house transportation chairman to move a multi year highway and transit bill in and when democrats controlled both chambers because lawmakers and the white house didn t want to take a vote on the gas tax probably one of the most difficult meetings that i had is the meeting i had with chairman oberstar when i told him that it was not going to be possible for obama and the administration to support an increase in the gas tax former transportation secretary ray lahood told politico last year as loyal readers know the white house inaction helped set the stage for years of stop and go extensions until congress passed a two year highway and transit bill in rail wars it s the latest salvo in the fight between amtrak and freight railroads on an on time performance metric and unfettered access to tracks the association of american railroads is demanding that the stb quit its efforts to hammer out a new definition of on time for amtrak and dismiss amtrak s request for an investigation into late arrivals if the stb sides with amtrak the freight railroads could face more onerous mandates ensuring they pull over and allow amtrak trains carrying passengers to zoom by uninhibited in a letter to the stb aar s lawyers pointed out a recent u s court of appeals decision and argued that the case supports aar s argument that congress granted amtrak and the fra not the board the power to define on time performance for purposes of triggering an investigation the aar added that the stb should terminate rulemaking on on time performance and dismiss amtrak s requests for investigations into the factors leading to late arrivals two days later amtrak shot back with its own later arguing that the cited court decision makes it clear that stb still has clear legal grounding to start up an investigation lauren s got all the juicy details on the battle of words between these railroads here borrowed time for gateway tunnel project foxx says transportation secretary anthony foxx was on cheerleading duty in midtown manhattan on friday for the billion gateway project that would replace a set of century old amtrak tubes that currently carry passengers per day most of them on new jersey transit we are light years ahead today versus a year ago foxx said friday speaking at the annual assembly hosted by the regional plan association but we still have many light years ahead of us he reiterated amtrak s forecast that the tubes will become so decrepit in coming years they will need to be shut down for safety that does not inspire confidence foxx said and that could be years from now it could be months from now it could be weeks from now it could be minutes from now abandon ship the international seafarers ministry is calling on the senate to abandon a provision included in the senate commerce committee s maritime administration reauthorization bill that would make it more difficult for

airlines need to get on board by equipping their planes and while he didn t mention the elephant in the room that delta stands alone among airlines in opposing plans to separate air traffic control from the faa one of the reasons delta s in opposition is because they think nextgen is poised to be a success if the industry cooperates that is certainly nextgen is not perfect but when i look at delay causes at delta air lines it s not atc it s self inflicted anderson said he pointed to bureau of transportation statistics data showing that delayed departures forced by air traffic control

three new members of the wmata board of directors with significant transportation expertise great minds delaney told mt on thursday afternoon when asked about the announcement we re pleased because they re basically doing something very consistent with what we started talking about in the last few weeks so i think it s a positive step d c del eleanor holmes norton added her approval in a statement also pointing out that the federal government has equal representation with the three jurisdictions on the wmata board of directors and has perhaps more at stake than any of the jurisdictions but does not shoulder any of the financial burden for wmata s daily operations who s in carol j carmody former ntsb member and vice chairman david strickland former nhtsa administrator and robert lauby current associate administrator for railroad safety and chief safety officer at the federal railroad administration lauby s appointment is particularly interesting considering how much flak the dot has received for choosing the federal transit administration and not the fra to temporarily manage safety oversight of metro who s out mort downey past chairman of the board and former u s transportation secretary harriet tregoning urban planning expert and anthony r giancola of the navy s civil engineer corps if you build it they will come metro board chairman jack evans said earlier this month that he believed there was a shortage of skilled candidates vying to serve on the board sometimes they re there because nobody else would come believe it or not evans said at the house oversight hearing but delaney insists that implementing new requirements will bring more qualified candidates out of the woodwork i think if you actually said this board is going to have real expertise i think you d get good people to serve because they d say i m going to serve with people who are really going to add value to managing metro delaney said as for the bill s chances the legislator was confident i think there ll be a lot of support cause it s kind of unassailable right how could you actually say that it s a bad idea to have qualified people on the board btw he didn t forget foxx also used the announcement about the board picks as an opportunity to tweak wmata for failing to set up a new safety oversight board i met with each of the jurisdictions a year ago and urged them to stand up a new safety oversight office they have not done so foxx said no more excuses wrda by summer supporters of the water resources development act hope both the senate bill and the

chief takes the hot seat â€” After big threat, Foxx offers kinder words to WMATAâ€™s Wiedefeld","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from lauren gardner heather caygle and katie jenningsbecause appropriations season isn t hard enough already as the thud bill gears up to hit the senate floor the opposition to the bill s controversial trucking rider is crescendoing and the naysaying is coming from both sides of the issue roadway safety advocates say the add on is a negative outcome of a completely closed process that will still allow truckers to work extra hours some trucking industry lobbying groups say their members flat out don t support the measure in part because it takes rulemaking power away from the federal agency tasked with regulating trucks and lawmakers are left in the middle to realize that their attempts to strike a compromise between two clashing interests has failed to satisfy almost anyone and they may have to revisit the issue and all this drama is unfolding against the backdrop of a senate that hasn t managed to pass one appropriations bill so far this year and lawmakers who are losing patience with eleventh hour battles over peripheral issues the senate s first spending bill the energy and water package is finally expected to pass today the crux of the issue our lauren gardner has all the details in her story but here s the gist a provision in the senate s appropriations bill which was released last month made a much sought tweak to a rider in last year s spending package that had been aimed at adding extra hurdles before regulators could modify trucking hours of service requirements that rider last year had language specifying which rule to apply if certain new benchmarks weren t met meaning the industry would have had to default to using hours of service regulations from more than a decade ago but folks throughout the industry were surprised when they saw that the new appropriations bill went beyond fixing that rider and also included language requiring truckers to take a hour break from driving after they hit hours of work driving plus loading and paperwork in a week the hour cap is a figure that has left some industry observers scratching their heads lauren writes how it will all pan out there will likely be interest among some democrats to address the issue on the floor though it s unclear what approach they might take our lauren gardner writes the advocates for highway and auto safety she says may push for lawmakers to strike the cap altogether or bump the hour reset requirement up to hours that s still up in the air but in an appropriations process that has already seen its fair share of drama on just one bill lauren writes it s also possible senators will defer to the compromise their colleagues already reached collins weighs in the limit was aimed at putting the perennial fights over hours of service to rest for good by taking federal regulators out of the equation and to upend safety groups argument that truckers could game the system to work upwards of hours a week sen susan collins chairwoman of the thud subcommittee told politico that she believes their solution remains the best approach a compromise proposal reached after input from democrats and republican appropriators i tried to come up with what i felt was a reasonable amount even though the average truck driver works far fewer than that number of hours a week collins told lauren further complications word on the street is that the thud package could also be the vehicle to advance money to combat the zika virus per several senators who talked to pro s budget and appropriations team it s thursday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s

testifies before the house oversight committee this morning giving the unclassified rundown on how well the agency has been doing since the ig s cadre of auditors was able to sneak fake bombs and weapons past tsa screeners out of times and tsa administrator peter neffenger will talk up the steps he has taken over the past year to improve workforce morale and to make sure checkpoint screeners are properly trained to pinpoint security threats something dhs s inspector general has found to be majorly lacking neffenger s big points since last year the entire screener workforce has gone through mission essential training to make sure they actually understand how to use the screening equipment and its limitations the agency has begun mandatory leadership training and has started making all newly hired screeners go to georgia for a tsa boot camp of sorts to try to prevent managers from retaliating against whistleblowers by ordering their reassignment the administrator has demanded that all reassignments be reviewed and approved high up the chain of command and to stop the practice of workers gifting egregiously generous bonuses to each other neffenger has capped the annual payouts at per employee granted only immediate supervisors the ability to hand out those awards and required that they be reviewed from on high following suit on tsa house appropriations committee leaders approved tsa s request to redirect million to help the agency handle growing screening lines this summer just one week after senate appropriators gave their own speedy thumbs up before the decision came out members of the house had urged the heads of the homeland security subcommittee to follow suit in a letter to chairman john carter and ranking member lucille roybal allard reps donald payne jr kathleen rice and bill keating cited reports that port authorities around the country were considering hiring private contractors to help augment security screening efforts if tsa does not increase staffing levels we have serious reservations about the prospect of a move towards privatized security at major american airports the trio of representatives wrote and with more than million passengers expected to fly in july and august alone we are also deeply concerned that this problem will grow much more severe in the coming months first thing s first the federal transit administration is ordering wmata to focus repair efforts on three stretches of track a further sign that fta is taking more assertive steps to exercise its regulatory powers delivering increasingly detailed mandates on when and how to perform maintenance work in an updated safety directive the fta said wmata must also provide the federal agency with its inspection and maintenance procedures for tunnel drainage and traction power cabling systems and a list of inspection staff responsible for overseeing them additionally acting fta administrator carolyn flowers is ordering wmata to set targets to monitor how well it s mitigating smoke and fire risks delays to come in response metro said it s revamping its long term system maintenance plan to hew to fta requirements a move that means wmata will likely need more time to finalize the schedule that had originally been expected to be set in stone by the beginning of next week while the draft safetrack plan issued by metro gm paul wiedefeld last week was based on the professional judgment of engineers with a priority on safety the fta has directed metro to make changes spokesman dan stessel said in a statement as such the draft plan will be modified a heckuva job even with harsh words about wmata s safety practices on tuesday not to mention threats to shut down the whole system transportation secretary anthony foxx softened his tone when he spoke about wiedefeld at a dot town hall meeting held at the agency s headquarters on wednesday i think paul wiedefeld the new general manager he has a heckuva job cause he s trying to dig this system out of a deep hole and we fully understand appreciate and respect the challenges of that foxx said at the town hall foxx also fielded a question from dara baldwin of the national disability rights network about what the agency is doing to ensure that people with disabilities stuck on trains with mechanical problems in the future can be safely evacuated from the train and that there are american sign language accommodations for deaf riders receiving emergency care in the event of a serious incident foxx s answer was pretty vague we issued a safety directive that speaks directly to emergency response foxx said and we fully expect wmata to comply with it one more thing foxx also used the town hall to offer a teaser on a new initiative he wants to put in place a citizen s academy operated by the dot to help educate community organizers and transportation advocates on how to better work with the government we ve been kicking around with our team the idea of a citizens academy that would be staged here at dot that would help demystify some of the processes and some of the terms and frankly help people understand better how to engage foxx said bridgegate redux the government s list of unindicted co conspirators believed to be involved in bridgegate is expected to drop on friday but gov chris christie told reporters he is highly doubtful his name will appear on the list the scandal surrounding george washington bridge lane closures he added is old news as politico new jersey s katie jennings explains the formal indictment of two christie staffers

a financial commitment that benefited a for profit company part owned by people with ties to the clintons including a current and a former democratic official and a close friend of former president bill clinton the million commitment was placed on the agenda for a september conference of the clinton global initiative at mr clintonâ s urging according to a document from the period and people familiar with the matter mr clinton also personally endorsed the company energy pioneer solutions inc to then energy secretary steven chu for a federal grant that year said people with knowledge of the endorsement the company whose business plan was to insulate peopleâ s homes and let them pay via their utility bills received an energy department grant mr chu now a professor at stanford university said he didnâ t remember the conversation the clinton global initiativeâ s help for a for profit company part owned by clinton friends poses a different issue under federal law tax exempt charitable organizations arenâ t supposed to act in anyoneâ s private interest but instead in the public interest on broad issues such as education or poverty â the organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests â the internal revenue service says on its website energy pioneer solutions was founded in by scott kleeb a democrat who twice ran for congress from nebraska an internal document from that year showed it as owned by mr kleeb by jane eckert the owner of an art gallery in pine plains n y and by julie tauber mcmahon of chappaqua n y a close friend of mr clinton who also lives in chappaqua owning each were democratic national committee treasurer andrew tobias and mark weiner a supplier to political campaigns and former rhode island democratic chairman both longtime friends of the clintons the clinton global initiative holds an annual conference at which it announces monetary commitments from corporations individuals or nonprofit organizations to address global challengesâ commitments on which it has acted in a matchmaking role typically the commitments go to charities and nongovernmental organizations the commitment to energy pioneer solutions was atypical because it originated from a private individual who was making a personal financial investment in a for profit company asked about the commitment foundation officials said â president clinton has forged an amazing universe of relationships and friendships throughout his life that endure to this day and many of those individuals and friends are involved in cgi commitments because they share a passion for making a positive impact in the world as opposed to a conflict of interest they share a common interest â a spokesman for mr clinton angel urena said â president clinton counts many cgi participants as friends â mrs clintonâ s campaign didnâ t respond to a request for comment a clinton foundation spokesman craig minassian called the commitment an instance of â mission driven investingâ in and by for profit companies â which he said â is a common practice in the broader philanthropic space as well as among cgi commitments â of thousands of cgi commitments mr minassian cited three other examples of what he described as mission driven investing involving a private party and a for profit company such as energy pioneer solutions ms eckert one of those identified as a owner of energy pioneer solutions in didnâ t respond to requests for comment ms mcmahon listed as another co owner said in an interview she didnâ t know how the commitment to the company came to be made as she wasnâ t involved ms mcmahon years old described mr clinton as â a family friend â mr kleeb who is the companyâ s chief executive as well as founder said ms mcmahon recruited mr weiner as an investor mr weiner has a company financial innovations inc that makes campaign souvenir items such as coffee mugs and pens mrs clintonâ s current and presidential runs have paid mr weinerâ s firm about million federal reports show mr weiner was among the first state democratic officials to endorse mr clinton for the presidency some years ago he has been a major donor to the clinton foundation and also to the campaign of virginia gov terry mcauliffe another clinton friend foundation and virginia records show mr weiner declined to be interviewed the other investor mr tobias has been the democratic national committee treasurer since he said he spent for equity in energy pioneer solutions and lent it â with my modest initial investment i wound up owning a small percentage of the company â mr tobias said in an email â it grew because ultimately between loans and equity investments iâ ve wound up putting a little more than million into this effort â mr tobias a best selling personal finance writer and long standing clinton global initiative member said he invested â because i would love to see the world more energy efficient and hoped to make some money doing that â records of the clinton foundation show he has given it between and the same donation level shown for mr weiner the companyâ s mr kleeb said he knew the dnc treasurer from his own runs for office and invited him to invest mr kleeb won democratic nominations in nebraska for the u s house in and the senate in but lost his wife jane kleeb led opposition to the keystone xl pipeline and now

new york in owned of energy pioneer solutions photo nicholas hunt patrick mcmullana spokesman for ms samuel a longtime member of the clinton global initiative said she ultimately chose not to give the full million this is a â personal financial matter and a personal investment â said her spokesman alan peck â following the initial september announcement and subsequent due diligence the actual investment was made by ms samuel to energy pioneer solutions on july â mr tobias the democratsâ treasurer said in an email a day after a journal interview that he too contributed to the commitment the announcement of it cited only ms samuel mr kleeb said the commitment announced was achieved and he raised million he didnâ t specify where the money came from the commitment was a late addition to the agenda for the september conference internal clinton foundation documents reviewed by the journal show according to one document about two weeks before the conference ms samuel contacted an official in the clinton foundationâ s commitments office and said mr clinton wanted to feature her commitment to energy pioneer solutions at that monthâ s gathering ms samuelâ s spokesman didnâ t respond to a question about that one of mr clintonâ s top advisers at the time doug band tried to prevent the commitment from being added to the agenda as an onstage event in the weeks prior to the conference according to a document reviewed by the journal the commitment was entered into a database on the clinton global initiative website a few months later it was removed the reason was to avoid calling attention to mr clintonâ s friendship with one company co owner ms mcmahon and to protect the integrity of mr clinton and the clinton global initiative according to people familiar with the matter the clinton foundation spokesman said the information was withheld at the request of ms samuel the announced provider of the commitment her spokesman didnâ t respond to a question on that scott kleeb

language in the companyâ s application which the journal obtained under the freedom of information act mr kleeb the companyâ s founder and owner didnâ t respond to a question on why it described itself as women owned on occasion mr clinton has trumpeted the companyâ s work speaking in to an omaha based syndicated radio show called the todd n tyler radio empire mr clinton said â thereâ s a group there called pioneer energy solutions that retrofits housingâ theyâ re in and out in a dayâ eight hours and theyâ re out of there â mr clinton also cited the operation without naming the company in his book â back to work â mr tobias the democratic treasurer said he discussed energy pioneer solutions frequently with mr clinton â i wasnâ t surprised that president clinton was psyched about the potential for eps and making americaâ s housing stock more efficient cutting co emissions and lowering consumersâ energy bills â mr tobias said energy pioneer solutions has struggled to operate profitably it lost more than in and another in the first half of said records submitted for an energy department audit mr kleeb noted that losses are common at startups the audit found deficiencies in how the company accounted for expenses paid with federal grant money energy department records show the company addressed the deficiencies and a revised cost proposal was approved in said an energy department spokeswoman joshunda sanders recently mr kleeb laid off most of his staff closed his offices sold a fleet of trucks and changed his business strategy promising to launch a national effort instead â we are right now gearing up to start under this new model â he said asked if energy pioneer solutions has ever broken even mr kleeb said â weâ re at that stageâ we are expanding and doing

"2016-05-12 07:25","Biden wanted Warren as his VP","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," biden wanted warren as his vpby glenn thrush and annie karni am edtjoe biden took months to decide he wouldn t run for president but he was sold on elizabeth warren as his running mate from the start people familiar with the situation told politico and he still thinks the massachusetts firebrand would be hillary clinton s best choice to replace him as the nation s no in january biden a stalwart democrat who has veered leftward in recent years but as a centrist senator voted to scuttle the glass steagall prohibitions on banks engaging in speculative investments favored warren because he needed a partner to capture the wave of anti bank anti establishment anger raging to his left warren a freshman senator from massachusetts who supports breaking up the big banks and re imposing s era wall street regulations to prevent another global financial crisis was biden s only real choice according to an official he spoke to at the time biden who told an interviewer on tuesday that he considered running for president because he believed he was the best person for the job took his hat out of the ring in late october citing the stresses on his family following the death of his son beau but he s recently told associates that warren would be an equally smart pick for hillary clinton who has been sharply criticized for refusing to publish the transcripts of her high paid speeches to the elite banking firm of goldman sachs biden a senior democratic official said first mentioned warren as a possible running mate during his earliest strategy sessions with a team of advisers that included friends mike donilon steve richetti and ted kaufman donilon the person said was particularly enthusiastic about it and biden broached the idea almost matter of factly to warren during a much hyped lunch meeting at the vice president s residence on the grounds of the naval observatory last september biden according to a person briefed on details of the meeting told warren he wanted her to be his running mate during the conversation but didn t explicitly ask her to commit to the slot or endorse his candidacy warren the person told politico was noncommittal but not displeased at that meeting she delivered a clear eyed assessment of biden s own chances according to a staffer who was given a read out of the conversation telling the vice president that he had little chance of positioning himself to the left of clinton given his own three decade record of moderate compromise in the senate warren conceded prophetically in retrospect that clinton would face a progressive backlash but she informed biden that his record on wall street was little better than that of the woman he hoped to topple as front runner as a senator biden like clinton had supported a bankruptcy bill that warren vehemently opposed her advice to biden was that to appeal to the left he would need to start talking right away about wall street reform a spokesman for warren declined to comment on the matter a biden spokeswoman said she didn t want to comment on internal discussions but kaufman a former delaware senator and biden s longtime aide and confidant said warren was a subject of discussion within biden s inner circle as he pondered a presidential run she s someone that was discussed kaufman said she s clearly someone anyone would consider but kaufman cautioned that the discussions never got to the point of making any promises about the role she might play on a potential biden campaign we were still deciding if he was going to run or not he said she s obviously someone you want to talk to the revelation of biden s interest in warren is timely the massachusetts senator who has not yet endorsed a candidate for president has been careful to avoid any statement that would indicate she favored ideological soulmate bernie sanders over the more centrist clinton but progressives have begun pitching warren as a possible clinton vice presidential pick to heal the divisions between the center and left of the democratic party after the protracted duel between clinton and sanders and warren hasn t entirely resisted the suggestion in part because it gives her leverage to influence clinton s potential staffing decisions in the treasury department and financial oversight boards on wednesday the year old former harvard law professor refused to rule out accepting an offer to join clinton on the ticket employing the kind of non answer answer she s used throughout much of the campaign to stay above the fray we ve got to get all of our nominations settled on the democratic side she told the website mic when asked the veep question for me i m going to keep doing my job every single day and i m not thinking about another job warren to the delight of clinton s staff has recently trained her fire on donald trump a move that many clintonites interpret as evidence that the darling of the democrats anti establishment wing might be willing to accept clinton despite the front runner s deep and lucrative connections to the new york financial services sector even if warren cut a deal to endorse clinton and serve in her administration it s not clear whether all of her backers or sanders steadfast supporters would automatically jump aboard the hillary bandwagon i find it highly improbable that a leading voice in the progressive movement whether it be elizabeth warren or someone else would want to be sitting in the vice president s office or in the cabinet said jonathan tasini a new york based sanders supporter who isn t ready to give up the fight for bernie would warren or any true progressive be willing to make the obvious compromises that a moderate corporate democrat hillary would demand i don t think so it s not clear whether biden has remained in touch with warren since their last meeting or what he thinks of the prospects that another progressive sanders would do for a democratic ticket but biden s close advisers are still high on the idea of warren as a running mate whoever tops the ticket elizabeth warren is really a great leader and someone who is dynamic and articulate kaufman said if you listen to what she says it s on point it s factual it s thoughtful i think she would add a lot to hillary s ticket to every ticket the most important thing is governing warren is someone you d like to have by your side when you re making these tough decisions for his part sanders seems ambivalent about being the vice presidential nominee on a ticket headed by a candidate he s relentlessly portrayed as a puppet of the moneyed elites he s continued to attack clinton s wall street fundraising while leaving open the possibility of rejoining the fold after the final primary ballots are cast next month earlier this year sanders senior strategist tad devine told politico the campaign was open to the idea of joining a ticket with clinton and sanders earlier this week declined to rule it out using virtually the same language as warren right now we are focused on the next five weeks of winning the democratic nomination sanders told cnn on tuesday if that does not happen we are going to fight as hard as we can on the floor of the democratic convention to make sure that we have a progressive platform that the american people will support then after that certainly secretary clinton and i can sit down and talk and see where we go from there to view online "

partnership and a compromise criminal justice reform bill the guiding insight of cruzâ s career has been that even republican voters are angry at republican leadership but as trump has split â or

"2016-05-05 12:21","POLITICO's Morning Transportation: Senate delivers on TSA funds hours after Johnson pleas â€” WMATA plans announcement on long-term maintenance schedule in coming days â€” Contrition from Takata on defective airbags? Not exactlyâ€¦","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from margaret harding mcgill jennifer scholtes heather caygle lauren gardner and ben weylthat was fast hours after homeland security secretary jeh johnson pleaded for congress to redirect funding to help tackle the looming prospect of calamitously long airport security lines sen john hoeven r n d chairman of the senate homeland security appropriations committee delivered he announced that he approved johnson s request to shift million in funding to the tsa ahead of the summer vacation season this fix which only affects funding for the summer is distinct from the ongoing battle over tsa funding in the appropriations process appropriators are mulling numbers for the fiscal year that begins in october still the senate s speedy response indicates a growing sympathy for tsa s plight among federal lawmakers where s the money coming from our jennifer scholtes has details the freed up funds will be put toward accelerating the hiring and training of security officers and more overtime pay while it is not yet clear which tsa accounts will be siphoned to come up with that cash some of the money will be taken from accounts for contracts that came in under budget according to the senate appropriations committee that s a big step toward addressing johnson s concerns but he is also looking for outside help in particular he wants more private companies to reimburse employees for enrolling in tsa precheck and he s asking that airports and airlines help with non security work at checkpoints such as returning storage bins to the front of screening lines a significant moment as jen noted earlier this week it s pretty unusual for an agency head to publicly complain about funding shortages during the appropriations process but calls for a stopgap solution for tsa s summer challenges have gone from insistent to dire in light speed prompted in part by forecasts of heretofore unseen security wait times published this week in politico and the new york times our no priority is keeping the traveling public safe which can and should be done without travelers waiting in security lines for hours on end hoeven said wednesday i expect tsa to work with the airports and airlines to ensure that all necessary steps are being taken to be effective and efficient in its duty to keep the public safe applause from the industry u s travel association president roger dow offered a stamp of approval the airports council international north america s kevin m burke weighed in too and took the opportunity to again call for raising the cap on the airport passenger facility charge tsa should deploy available resources in a more effective way including reallocating existing staff to checkpoints empowering local tsa officials to make staffing decisions and initiating local hiring and training initiatives burke writes congress can do its part to reduce long security lines by providing tsa with adequate resources and modernizing the local passenger facility charge user fee to fund needed infrastructure projects that will bolster security and improve passenger flows in

shutdowns is likely to come in the next few days according to a report from nbc washington will the blue line get shut down for six months we ll have to wait to find out wamu has an excerpt from general manager paul wiedefeld s memo to the board of directors the hard truth is that hours a week is not enough to dig out of the deferred maintenance hole and at this rate we will not reach an acceptable state of safety and reliability for several years i am requesting an executive session on friday to walk you through the plan as well as seek your assistance in asking for the jurisdictions to provide support ratcheting up the the recall nhtsa s announcement that they re doubling the size of the takata airbag recall list was hardly a surprise the agency has been criticized for months for moving too slowly to incorporate more vehicle makes and models to the emergency recall efforts especially after an airbag inflator was believed to have killed someone driving a car not yet under recall still the announcement brings the total number of recalled airbags up to a hefty million a big problem considering that owners of cars with defective airbags are already waiting months for repairs the acceleration of this recall is based on scientific evidence and will protect all americans from airbag inflators that may become unsafe transportation secretary anthony foxx said in a statement contrite not exactly in a statement takata said the company has agreed to initiate the expanded recalls as part of restoring public confidence but stopped several steps short of actually agreeing that there was any scientific basis to the expanded recall even suggesting that auto manufacturers could also be to blame for the lethal defective inflators takata is not aware of any ruptures in the field or in testing in the inflator products in vehicles that would be covered by this new order nor is takata aware of any new data or scientific analysis that suggests any substantial risk with respect to such vehicles takata said in a statement manufacturing variability may also pay a role in the inflator failures and certain vehicle models have been shown to have a much higher incident rate than others they can t get no satisfaction for months sens richard blumenthal and ed markey have called for all the affected takata airbags to be immediately recalled and replaced and they rehashed those calls on wednesday repeated stopgap partial steps like today s will only continue to put drivers their passengers and even others on the road at urgent risk the senators said in a statement until all takata airbags are replaced with truly reliable protective products that don t use ammonium nitrate and have proven that they pass most stringent quality assurance testing standards takata s spiraling record of fatal tragedy will continue auto industry pushes obama on airwaves automakers safety advocates and state transportation departments are joining forces in a new letter to president barack obama that describes the virtues of vehicle to vehicle technology and the potential danger of forcing autos using dedicated short range communications or dsrc to share airwaves with wi fi the letter sent wednesday and made public today was signed by ford general motors and dozens of others it comes a week after google and others asked for the administration s help in making the gigahertz band which is set aside for connected cars available for sharing with wi fi the carmakers in the letter today pointed to programs for vehicle to infrastructure technology in san francisco and elsewhere and gm s plans to install the tech in the cadillac cts those asking for delay seek to reconfigure the ghz dsrc band in a way that would impair safety critical applications and jeopardize their public benefits the letter says this would sweep away more than a decade of research and development as well as delay for perhaps another decade dsrc

committee is only announcing spending allocations for each bill as it is voted on even though republican subcommittee chairmen have at least some idea of how much money they have to work with

group of senior bernie sanders staffers and volunteers is circulating a draft proposal calling on the senator to get out of the presidential race after the final burst of democratic primaries on june and concentrate on building a national progressive organization to stop donald trump operating under the assumption that sanders will win the california primary but still fall far short of amassing enough delegates to claim the democratic nomination the document calls for the vermont senator to exit the race and launch an independent political group far larger than any other recent post campaign political operations such as those started by howard dean or barack obama the working title for the roughly word document after winning on june th bernie sanders should suspend his campaign and launch an independent organization to defeat donald trump at the same time people closer to sanders and his campaign team have been holding their own big picture conversations about the shape of the post primary sanders machine for months zeroing in on specific questions in recent weeks about what the goals should be and how it would work both efforts to sketch out the sanders end game are working under the premise that hillary clinton will likely be the party s nominee but a standard bearer who will struggle to bring sanders voters along with her that s led some of the discussions to focus on how best to use sanders vaunted email list to energize his backers against trump and whether to help down ballot candidates who share sanders views for the moment sanders remains publicly focused on amassing delegates via the remaining primaries so he can reach the democratic convention in july with a significant force that can shape the proceedings but even as he racks up victories most recently in indiana and west virginia he s faced repeated questions about his intentions with some of his highest profile supporters questioning his plan to stay in through july the group of over a dozen sanders backers crafting the proposal a collection of volunteers and current and former sanders staff members all veterans of other high profile campaigns including barack obama s who insist on anonymity believes that leaving an imprint on the party platform is an overrated goal they suggest that the vermont senator should exit the race if it s clear he cannot win a call similar to the one made by oregon sen jeff merkley his lone senate endorser rather than spend the five weeks before the convention in limbo that approach would allow clinton to confront trump more directly and earlier than expected even priorities usa action the main pro clinton super pac has signaled that it wishes to go on the offensive sooner than originally planned by revealing this week that it will move up the start time of its ads from june senator sanders should proceed to lay out his plan to build an organization completely independent of the clinton campaign that will single mindedly devote itself to educating americans about the threat of right wing some say fascist takeover and the task of identifying and mobilizing voters to defend our democracy in november and beyond call it revolution or another name that best speaks to base and message and its focused task over the next months might be to mobilize voters under with likely positive impacts on senate and congressional races reads a copy of the draft proposal obtained by politico while sanders will likely speak at july s official democratic convention in philadelphia the document proposes that he and his aides host a convention event of their own to spur excitement and launch this group the best organized independent expenditure organization in history that will give the vast and deeply anti establishment base a vehicle into which they will whole heartedly pour their energy such an effort they write would help bridge the gap between clinton and the large cadre of young newly political sanders supporters that sees rejection of hillary and the democratic party establishment as core to their identity if the group was at first focused primarily on combating trump the thinking goes it would provide those sanders fans with justification for eventually voting for clinton this is a populist year in american electoral politics with signs that it may mark the beginning of a populist era it would be very unwise for the decidedly un populist hillary clinton to move with too much confidence towards a full on confrontation with donald trump they continue a sanders led as opposed to sanders centered independent entity could provide a much needed articulate and energized economic populist voice to the anti trump effort without the intrinsic compromising effect posed by close association with neoliberal democratic elites as well as weaning the volunteer base off total reliance on individual candidates during one off election cycles the still circulating proposal by far the most advanced version of a post primary discussion to surface acknowledges that there are significant kinks still to work out in the post primary plan first and foremost how to fund the proposed independent entity while sanders has sustained his campaign with an online fundraising juggernaut the pace of its donations has already slowed and it s unlikely that he would be able to keep up a constant money flow beyond the campaign season as a result acknowledge the proposal drafters he would be faced with the question of accepting big checks from individual donors a direct contradiction with a central tenet of his current campaign bernie sanders may either believe that it is a principle even outside of a candidacy or feel that he is boxed in by the rhetoric of the campaign they write controls could easily be applied such as an open process governed by a diverse panel of volunteers who could accept or reject large donations e g in excess of but in the end bernie sanders himself would have to decide where

to its Obamacare problems?","pulse@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by dan diamond am edtthere s republican infighting over zika funding and cdc just dropped a massive report crammed with national health data but first a preview of today s bruising senate hearing on drug prices what valeant ceo will tell the senate we were too aggressive on price increase that s according to prepared testimony from michael pearson who s striking a conciliatory tone ahead of the senate aging committee s hearing on drug prices this afternoon pro s sarah karlin smith reports regrets the outgoing ceo has a few the infamous drug company has made mistakes pearson writes particularly being too aggressive in pursuing price increases on certain drugs he also regrets pursuing transactions where a central premise was to buy older drugs and increase the price but he also thinks the senate s getting valeant s story wrong pearson tried to frame the valeant drug price hikes as outliers noting the committee s investigation has focused on just three of the company s products he also emphasized valeant s investment in r amp d and its commitment to programs that assist patients in paying for drugs moving forward pearson may be leaving valeant but he said the company is working to rethink its approach to drug pricing and that it will track industry norms and he testifies that its new policies will involve greater formality and reflect the painful lesson we have learned over the last year see pearson s testimony percent that s how much drug list prices went up last year according to a recent ims health report and don t be surprised to hear that number cited at today s hearing but it s worth noting that list prices don t account for the discounts and rebates that many patients providers and insurers receive to defray the cost of the drugs what house dems are saying to valeant you re not playing ball a memo from the house oversight committee democrats obtained by politico indicates valeant is not fully cooperating with its investigation in drug price hikes according to the memo valeant withheld documents from the committee claiming they were protected by attorney client privilege but it later became clear that the documents weren t covered by that privilege these documents which included financial analyst reports prepared by multiple firms indicate that the u s government is now paying the company more than billion a year because of its massive price increases the democrats argue valeant as symptom of bigger issues the documents also show how widespread these abuses are across the entire drug industry ranking member elijah cummings told politico the memo indicates that members have ongoing concerns about other documents the company continues to withhold from the house committee too welcome to wednesday pulse where i m still counting the votes from last night s primaries tips to ddiamond politico com or ddiamond on twitter with help from

foundation expert argues that united only has itself to blame the thing is this really says more about unitedhealthcare than it does about the aca larry levitt writes in the jama forum the company s

medicaid health plan operator closed the first quarter with exchange customers in states says it s turning a profit on the aca exchanges and isn t ruling out expanding into additional markets ceo michael neidorff said on an investor call yesterday centene s exchange experience continues to be favorable he stressed don t expect centene to step in where united fell out however the two companies pursued different patient populations on the exchange neidorff said with united customers opting for broader more expensive plans than the low price plans that centene usually offers they re in a

summer especially in southern states many states that could be affected by the virus lagged in the survey and while much still isn t known about zika we do know that having adequate lab testing for this type of virus is important says glen mays the university of kentucky professor overseeing the survey not all states have that capability states that are the most prepared maryland new york minnesota states that are the least prepared louisiana montana arizona mississippi why no puerto rico yesterday s pulse reported on leapfrog group s latest hospital rankings which found that

on","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edttrump is the gop nominee as predicted in this space yesterday donald trump rolled to a big win in indiana and ted cruz dropped out of the gop presidential race trump is now on track to hit the delegates he needs to win the nomination on the first ballot in cleveland in july the focus now shifts to how republicans will deal with the fact that trump who is neither a fiscal nor a social conservative is their standard bearer some began on tuesday to line up behind the manhattan based brand manager the rnc officially acknowledged trump as the victor but there are plenty of big names including cruz who have not lined up behind trump and may never do so how could cruz possibly back trump now the texas senator just called trump a pathological liar utterly amoral a narcissist at a level i don t think this country s ever seen and a serial philanderer that s a tough bell to unring and what of jeb bush mitt romney marco rubio and all the rest on wall street the question now becomes whether republicans grudgingly get in line or sit the race out and quietly or perhaps not so quietly hope clinton wins mm s money is on the latter trump represents a major tail risk for markets and the economy he could wind up being ok as president but he could also create massive disruption through trade wars mass deportations and destabilized relations with traditional allies wall street usually shies away from that kind of risk dems prepare to destroy trump via politico hillary clinton s campaign signaled on tuesday that it will paint donald trump as an unstable dangerous bully with no interest in helping ordinary americans judging from comments made by campaign chairman john podesta trump is too divisive and lacks the temperament to be president podesta wrote in a statement issued after the real estate mogul won the indiana republican presidential primary fundamentally our next president will need to do two things keep our nation safe in a dangerous world and help working families get ahead here at home podesta said donald trump is not prepared to do either warren comes out blazing sen elizabeth warren

hillaryclinton neverclinton never trump vows to fight on via katie packer while tonight s indiana primary results increased donald trump s delegate count trump remains short of the delegates needed to win the gop nomination a substantial number of delegates remain up for grabs in this highly unpredictable year in addition there is more than a month before the california primary more time for trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters as he did yet again today spreading absurd tabloid lies about ted cruz s father and the jfk assassination bernie wins indiana pledges to fight on politico s matthew nussbaum sen bernie sanders fresh off a surprise victory in the indiana primary is confident that he is only helping the democratic party by remaining in the race against hillary clinton the clinton campaign thinks this is over they re wrong sanders told the associated press we are bringing literally millions of people into the political process sanders said of his campaign but sanders can t win politico s gabriel debenedetti there s one more reason for bernie sanders focus his energy on winning over super delegates it s now mathematically impossible for him to reach the magic number for the democratic nomination by winning the remaining pledged delegates alone here s how it works after winning indiana sanders has pledged delegates and super delegates to his name

justice prosecutors meted out a special kind of justice for jeffrey epstein larded with fawning obsequiousness secret dealings and an astoundingly lenient sentence after all billionaires even billionaire sex abusers aren t like you and me investigators documented that at least underage girls some as young as were repeatedly exploited by epstein and his buddies for their carnal amusement at his palm beach mansion from to according to court documents the girls were required to administer topless or nude massage while mr epstein masturbated himself occasionally the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse state and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of federal and state sex crimes to two state charges soliciting prostitution and procuring a person younger than for prostitution meanwhile the feds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges they granted immunity to his various co conspirators the federal prosecutors who seemed cowed by epstein s high powered attorneys including roy black kenneth starr and alan dershowitz worked out the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser would be spared federal charges the failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal lawsuit filed in west palm beach against the u s attorney s office in by two of the young women identified as jane doe no and jane doe no on wednesday their attorneys filed a page motion demanding a summary judgment in their favor whether or not u s district judge kenneth marra grants the motion the document along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic emails and letters from prosecutors to epstein s legal team sure as hell prove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the u s justice system the correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet plea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of it one exchange suggested that he plead guilty in miami which would hopefully cut the press coverage significantly no wonder epstein received a piddling month sentence for a crime that got less exalted sex offenders in florida or years hard time his less than hard time amounted to months in the palm beach county stockade except he was allowed to spend hours a day six days a week at his nicely appointed office as part of a work release program he then served the balance of his sentence under house arrest quite an imposition for someone with a luxury mansion on the barrier island consider that this occurred at a time when low rent sex offenders were forced to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath miami s julia tuttle causeway without water toilets electricity of course super rich epstein managed to avoid such indignities nowadays the convict is occasionally featured in tabloid photos snapped as he flits about new york in the company of young beautiful women justice the special justice for billionaires has been served the miami herald feb justin bieber hires high powered lawyer roy black in dui case justin bieber is bringing in the big guns in a bid to beat his dui charge the singer who was arrested in miami early

creator joe francis and conservative radio commentator rush limbaugh the year old pop star who is canadian is being charged with dui driving without a valid driver s license out of the state of georgia and resisting arrest without violence jeffrey epstein attorney roy black denies allegations in letter by ex u s attorney alexander acostaattorney roy black is disputing claims that he and other attorneys representing jeffrey epstein pried into federal prosecutors personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender black also denies epstein s attorneys negotiated in bad faith while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors in a written response tuesday to the palm beach daily news black disputes claims made against epstein s defense team by former u s attorney alexander acosta those and other allegations by acosta were contained in a three page letter printed friday in the online publication the daily beast acosta was the u s attorney for the southern district of florida at the time epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple sex crimes with minor girls black the miami attorney who successfully defended william kennedy smith against rape charges was part of epstein s legal dream team epstein was never charged with a federal crime he and his attorneys struck a deal with federal prosecutors which was outlined in a non prosecution agreement according to the agreement epstein had to plead guilty to two state charges register as a lifelong sex offender and serve months in jail if he successfully completed those terms and served one year of probation then epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related to approximately to victims in a written response to the daily news black said we did present argument after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against mr epstein was unsupported by the evidence we detailed the so called evidence during many meetings with prosecutors and agents we were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our investigation and i believe we made a convincing case why charges were not appropriate i still believe that today according to acosta now dean of the florida international university college of law federal prosecutors and agents met with black in the summer of the prosecutors presented epstein a choice plead guilty to state felony charges resulting in two years imprisonment registration as a sex offender and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial what followed acosta said was that epstein s defense team launched a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors i use the word assault intentionally as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which i or the prosecutors in my office had previously encountered acosta said in his letter among the legal superstars on epstein s defense team harvard professor alan dershowitz kenneth starr jay lefkowitz and several others including prosecutors who had formally worked in the u s attorney s office and in the child exploitation and obscenity section of the justice department acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him the office s excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter black said he s never heard anyone mention writing a book about the epstein case mr acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the department of justice in washington black said any person under investigation by a united states attorney meaning any of the such offices in the country has the right to seek review by the department of justice and it is so provided for in their manual thus i cannot imagine invoking this right could be construed as bad faith in our system of justice people are given the right of appeal and there should be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it finally mr acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecutors black said i am not sure what he refers to but this never happened we did point out misconduct and over reaching by certain people involved in the investigation not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a necessary part of the process there will always be people who abuse the great power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occurs the non prosecution agreement was sealed in epstein s state felony file until victims attorneys successfully argued to make the document public in september palm beach daily news march a rod escalates war with yankees team responds with a challenge embattled yankee alex rodriguez escalated his war with team higher ups via comments from his new new york lawyer suggesting the team purposely mistreated him medically and yankees president randy levine responded saturday afternoon with a strong challenge for rodriguez levine offered to

years ago so trump told the story of the hotel they sat in of the deal that would form the foundation of his real estate empire â it turned out â he told the audience more than once â to be a great great success as a hotel â washington post elahe izadithe longtime former butler to presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump called for president obama to be killed and now the secret service said it will conduct an investigation liberal magazine mother jones reported on anthony senecal s facebook posts including one from wednesday in which he wrote obama should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term the post was only visible to his facebook friends but senecal confirmed its authenticity to mother jones saying i wrote that i believe that the u s secret service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation agency spokesman robert hoback said in an email thursday the trump campaign denounced senecal s messages and distanced itself from the former butler at trump s estate the mar a lago in palm beach fla tony senecal has not worked at mar a lago for years but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him regarding the president trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks said via email new york times jeremy w petersthere is little doubt that donald j trump will emerge from the republican national convention in cleveland as the partyâ s presidential nominee but there is still some uncertainty about what could unfold there starting july over the course of four days mr trump will have to navigate potential hazards like hostile delegates suspicious of his conservatism and determined to thwart his candidacy complicating matters further many of those delegates possess an intricate knowledge of the parliamentary process that establishes the conventionâ s rules and program any of them looking to make trouble certainly could try recent political conventions have grown so scripted and choreographed that moments of true spontaneity are rare this year when history seems to be providing little guiding precedent could be the one that shatters the calm new york times ashley parkerdonald j trump came to washington on thursday to unify the republican party behind him that did not quite happen but here is what did the political denizens showed once again that mr trump the reality tv star turned presumptive republican presidential nominee can animate the staid capital as much as any other city in america it helped that mr trumpâ s visit happened to coincide with the national cannabis industry associationâ s annual lobbying trip to the capitol and onlookers would have been forgiven for thinking that washington had accidentally eaten the entire pan of brownies the least exciting part of the whole trumpapalooza was the meetings themselves â those closed door huddles between mr trump and republican leaders which produced bland statements of â party unityâ on both sides but little actual news yet the politely subdued signals from both factions belied the frenzy just outside the republican national committeeâ s cream colored building where the first two of mr trumpâ s meetings occurred there more than three dozen protesters and more than five dozen members of the news media arrived early as a morning rush hour crowd looked on quizzically new york times paul krugmanthis seems to be the week for trump tax mysteries one mystery is why donald trump unlike every other major party nominee in modern times is refusing to release his tax returns the other is why having decided that he needs experts to clean up his ludicrous tax cut proposals he chose to call on the services of the gang that couldnâ t think straight on the first mystery mr trumpâ s excuse that he canâ t release his returns while theyâ re being audited is an obvious lie on the contrary the fact that heâ s being audited or at least that he says heâ s being audited should make it easier for him to go public â after all he neednâ t fear triggering an audit clearly he must be hiding something what it could be how little he pays in taxes a revelation that hurt mitt romney in but i doubt it given how mr trump rolls heâ d probably boast that his ability to game the tax system shows how smart he is compared to all the losers out there new york times steven rattnertype â trump system riggedâ into the google search bar and youâ ll get more than hits i didnâ t inspect all of them but the first were variants of donald trump complaining that the republican primary process was tilted against him thatâ s beyond ironic mr trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system the tax code which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business throughout his career mr trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find heâ s boasted about it â iâ ve taken advantage of the laws of this country like other people â mr trump has said the republican front runner has been dodging releasing his returns on the specious grounds that he was being audited on tuesday he told the associated press that he wouldnâ t release them before the election â period on wednesday he denied saying this reversed course and said â hopefully before the election iâ ll release â â thereâ s nothing to learn from them â he said in the associated press interview iâ ll bet thereâ s plenty to learn more likely mr trump doesnâ t want us to know how small his tax hit is something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign before realizing that it could come back to bite him washington post michelle ye hee leetrump started a recent rally in california by bringing onstage members of the remembrance project which advocates for family members of those killed by undocumented immigrants trump asked the father of jamiel shaw to share the story of his son a year old football star who was killed in by a gang member who was in the country illegally shaw has appeared in an ad for trump and supports trumpâ s proposal to deport all â criminal aliens â who are noncitizens convicted of a crime another case trump often points to is that of kate steinle a young woman in san francisco who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant and a repeat felon who had been deported five times to mexico clearly stories like this exist but trump uses anecdotes as evidence to connect illegal immigration and violent crimes and to propose deporting the approximately million undocumented believed to be living in the united states just how likely are americans to die from homicide by undocumented immigrants washington post eugene robinsonsave us all the faux drama we already know how this star crossed courtship is going to end house speaker paul d ryan r wis will decide that donald trump isnâ t such an ogre after all and theyâ ll live unhappily ever after ryan will be unhappy at least trump has stolen his party and thereâ s nothing ryan can do in the short term to get it back â i heard a lot of good things from our presumptive nominee â ryan told reporters after his much ballyhooed thursday meeting with trump â i do believe we are now planting the seeds to get ourselves unified to bridge the gaps and differences â translation ryan may still not be â there yet â in terms of a formal endorsement but we should have no doubt about where heâ s headed trump came to washington for meetings with ryan and other gop establishment figures as a conqueror not a supplicant his populism xenophobia isolationism bigotry and evident love of big government may be anathema to the republican elite but the partyâ s base clearly feels otherwise anyone choosing self interest over principle â a habit i have observed among politicians â would think twice about opposing a man who has received more primary votes than any previous gop nominee politico eli stokolsit was exactly the kind of scripted political photo op that donald trump loves to disparage as phony yet there he was waving to a phalanx of photographers outside rnc headquarters smiling and playing along for an hour the republican partyâ s presumptive nominee sat face to face with house speaker paul ryan who just a week ago surprised trump by declaring he couldnâ t yet support his candidacy and soon after it was over both men issued a statement expressing optimism about working together â ryan saying he was â very encouragedâ and trump calling it a â great meeting â but those platitudes are window dressing a temporary distraction from the still real rift dividing the gopâ s intellectual class personified by ryan and the frustrated blue collar base that has anointed a billionaire populist as the partyâ s new standard bearer indeed while trump ryan and rnc chairman reince priebus have spent the last week trying to tell the country that thereâ s nothing to see here there is in fact still plenty to see politico kenneth p vogel and ben schreckingerdonald trumpâ s campaign is considering hitting his republican enemies where it hurts their wallets as trump moves to work in closer concert with the republican national committee apparatus some campaign aides and allies are pushing him to block lucrative party contracts from consultants who worked to keep him from winning the nomination according to four sources familiar with the discussions â the never trump vendors and supporters shouldnâ t be in striking distance of the rnc any of its committees or anyone working on behalf of donald trump â said a trump campaign official the blacklist talk â which sources say mostly targets operatives who worked for never trump groups but also some who worked for trumpâ s gop presidential rivals or their supportive super pacs â strikes against a republican consulting class that trump has assailed as a pillar of a corrupt political establishment itâ s a sweet bit of turnabout for trump aides and consultants who in recent months were warned that their work for the anti establishment billionaire real estate showman could diminish their own career prospects politico steven shepardhalf of republicans think donald trump hurt his chances in november during his tumultuous first week as the apparent gop presidential nominee thatâ s according to the politico caucus â a panel of activists strategists and operatives in key swing states â which weighed in immediately following this weekâ s primaries in nebraska and west virginia republicans who thought trump dropped the ball pointed to an erratic week â which included shifting positions on key issues pandering tweets and an interview with the associated press in which trump suggested he would eschew the mechanics of modern politics â let me count the waysâ it was a bad week for trump said an iowa republican â cinco de mayo taco bowl saying data and analytics don t matter in a national campaign twitter fights with elizabeth warren oh and questioning need to honor full faith and credit obligations to u s debt holders â â come on â a florida republican added â his next hispanic outreach plan involves a chihuahua from â but some thought trump s attempts at rapprochement with house speaker paul ryan and other establishment republicans would aid him in unifying the gop and saw hints that the gop was uniting behind trump despite the nomineeâ s missteps politico hanna trudodonald trump is done with jeff bezos in an interview with fox newsâ sean hannity on thursday night the presumptive republican presidential nominee alleged that the amazon founder uses the washington post to secure tax benefits for his company â every hour weâ re getting calls from reporters from the washington post asking ridiculous questions and i will tell you this is owned as a toy by jeff bezos who controls amazon â trump said in response to hannity s question about how the paper has assigned some reporters to dig deep into his life amazon is â getting away with murder tax wise â said trump â heâ s using the washington post for power so that the politicians in washington donâ t tax amazon like they should be taxed bezos who purchased the post in for million has a broader â antitrustâ problem trump alleged â amazon is controlling so much of what theyâ re doing â he said â and what theyâ ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and heâ s using that as a tool for political power against me and against people and iâ ll tell you what we canâ t let him get away with it â trump went on to criticize the post s reporters who he claimed have reported inaccurately on his life editorials op edswashington post stanley greenbergmoderate republicans will have the last word in this dramatic presidential election year the gop establishment and its favored candidates view these voters as illegitimate which is why they lost the primaries to donald trump now moderates are poised to play similarly decisive roles in the general election â by helping to elect democrat hillary clinton â and in the battle for the partyâ s future that will follow it moderates stand out starkly among the groups that make up the republican base for two reasons they are disproportionately college graduates in a white working class party and they are socially liberal they have been alienated from a party that wonâ t accept the revolution that has occurred in american social and sexual mores and move on because no candidate this cycle spoke to their issues and grievances these voters can seem invisible but according to polling we conducted at democracy corps in february moderates make up a stunning percent of the gop base usa today the editorial boardfor decades republicans have promoted limited government family values and american leadership on the world stage in recent days however these time honored principles have been called into question as top officeholders have embraced donald trump the presumptive presidential nominee who rejects much of what has defined the gop for generations on thursday house speaker paul ryan the partyâ s intellectual leader and rising star edged closer to jumping on the trump train after a much ballyhooed meeting on capitol hill ryan and trump said they were â totally committed to working together â though ryan again stopped short of a formal endorsement the unlikely passengers already boarding include florida sen marco rubio who called trump unqualified just months ago and arizona sen john mccain whose heroism as a prisoner of war in vietnam was questioned by trump new york times the editorial boardnearly years after the war in afghanistan is raging and pakistan deserves much of the blame it remains a duplicitous and dangerous partner for the united states and afghanistan despite billion in american aid and repeated attempts to reset relations on a more constructive course in coming weeks gen john nicholson jr the new american commander in afghanistan will present his assessment of the war itâ s likely to be bleak and may question the wisdom of president obamaâ s goal of cutting the american force of troops to by the end of the year the truth is regardless of troop levels the only hope for long term peace is negotiations with some factions of the taliban the key to that is pakistan pakistanâ s powerful army and intelligence services have for years given support to the taliban and the haqqani terrorist network and relied on them to protect pakistani interests in afghanistan and prevent india from increasing its influence there under american pressure the pakistan army recently waged a military campaign against the taliban in the ungoverned border region but the haqqanis still operate in relative safety in pakistan some experts say the army has helped engineer the integration of the haqqanis into the taliban leadership new york times the editorial boardhours after senators voted overwhelmingly to put her on trial for alleged financial trickery president dilma rousseff of brazil denounced the effort to impeach her as a coup â i may have committed errors but i never committed crimes â ms rousseff said that is debatable but ms rousseff is right to question the motives and moral authority of the politicians who are seeking to oust her the brazilian president who was re elected in for a four year term has been a lousy politician and an underwhelming leader but there is no evidence that she abused her power for personal gain while many of the politicians orchestrating her ouster have been implicated in a huge kickback scheme and other scandals brazilâ s supreme court ruled last week that eduardo cunha the veteran lawmaker who has led the effort to oust ms rousseff must leave office to stand trial on corruption charges vice president michel temer who took charge of the country on thursday could be ineligible to run for office for eight years because election authorities recently disciplined him for violating campaign finance limits new york times the editorial boardrepublicans in the new york state senate are eager to punish mayor bill de blasio for campaigning against them two years ago in a failed attempt to restore democratic control in the legislature grudges like this are a natural part of politics but it would be irresponsible of lawmakers to punish new york cityâ s million schoolchildren as a way of settling a score with mr de blasio the senate seemed headed in that direction last week when lawmakers held a hearing on whether or not to renew the law that gave mayor michael bloomberg control over the largest public school system in the country the law has been an unqualified success it allowed the city to finally create clear lines of authority in a byzantine bureaucracy that was riddled with cronyism it was even unclear at times how many people were employed in the system the mayoral control law allowed the city to put in place policy changes that would have been almost impossible under the old regime mr bloomberg for example was able to close failing schools that had turned into dropout factories and replace them with smaller specialized schools that served students better new york times the editorial boardon thursday paul ryan speaker of the house and donald trumpâ s highest ranking republican skeptic sat down with mr trump the partyâ s presumed presidential nominee to find â common ground â it took minutes â we will be having additional discussions but remain confident thereâ s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall â a joint statement said afterward reince priebus the republican national committee chairman said the meeting was a â very positive step toward party unity â and noted their â very good chemistry â though he did not endorse mr trump mr ryan called him â a very warm and genuine person â mr trump spent part of their private meeting declaring his openness to republican policies heâ d disagreed with a day before for a time it seemed that mr ryan might take a stand against mr trump now it appears that he will wind up embracing a candidate who repudiates some republican policies while also personifying many of the partyâ s most retrograde views new york times ted cruzon monday the iranian militaryâ s deputy chief of staff announced that the islamic republic had successfully tested yet another ballistic missile â this time a high precision midrange weapon with a reported reach of kilometers or miles and with a degree of accuracy that he claimed to be â without any error â if these statements are true the entire middle east including israel is within the reach of the mullahsâ missiles it was not revealed if this missile had its genocidal intent actually inscribed on it as other missiles recently tested by the islamic revolutionary guards corps have â with the inscription in hebrew â israel should be erased from the map â but it hardly matters the mullahsâ objectives are plain enough for anyone with eyes to see the iranian regime is continuing its determined march toward not only a nuclear weapon but also the means to launch it first against israel and then against the united states this reality makes all the more inexplicable president obamaâ s steadfast faith that since the election of president hassan rouhani in iran has been charting a â more moderate courseâ to the detriment of the old time hard liners and that mr rouhani and his administration would be reliable partners in negotiations over iranâ s nuclear program washington post sheldon adelsonat the outset of the election the gop primary field was nearly as large as that of last weekendâ s kentucky derby in total republican hopefuls campaigned to win the partyâ s nomination for president like the derby the race for the republican nomination started from a wide gate â some entries with better post positions others with more backing we had candidates with such perceived advantages as wide name identification large campaign war chests supposed geographic benefits and other assets they hoped would tip the race in their direction ultimately each candidate had to convince the partyâ s primary voters across the country that he or she deserved to be the nominee one candidate has won that race and now republicans must join together to make sure he wins the next one while the primary cycle still has some important elections ahead it is clear that donald trump will be the republican nominee for president i am endorsing trumpâ s bid for president and strongly encourage my fellow republicans â especially our republican elected officials party loyalists and operatives and those who provide important financial backing â to do the same usa today sen jeff sessionsfor the first time in a long time this november will give americans a clear choice on perhaps the most important issue facing our country and our civilization whether we remain a nation state that serves its own people or whether we slide irrevocably toward a soulless globalism that treats humans as interchangeable widgets in the world market in donald trump we have a forceful advocate for america trump has said that our trade immigration and foreign policies must be changed to protect the interests of american workers and our nation in hillary clinton we have a committed globalist clinton was an ardent supporter of the trans pacific partnership â which surrenders american sovereignty to an international union of countries â and has clearly left the door wide open to enacting the pact if elected there is only one sure way to defeat the tpp and that is to defeat hillary clinton meanwhile clintonâ s immigration platform is the most radical in our history freezing deportations ending detentions halting enforcement sheâ d expand president obamaâ s illegal amnesty decree effectively creating open borders clintonâ s extremist proposal economically targets our poor african american and hispanic communities whose wages and job prospects are being steadily eroded by the huge influx of new foreign workers washington post editorial boardbesides his usual brazenness something unsettling lurks behind donald trumpâ s latest statement that â unlike every other nominee in modern times â he will not make public his tax returns before the november election â thereâ s nothing to learn from them â he told the associated press earlier he claimed he could not release his returns because he was being audited then he said on twitter they would be released â when audit is complete not after election â to voters considering his fitness to be president mr trumpâ s response is that he will be the judge and jury a paternalistic and insulting attitude toward the public in fact there would be much to learn from mr trumpâ s tax returns and more broadly his years as a businessman weâ re not picking this criterion out of thin air mr trump is the one who repeatedly trumpets his business experience as his qualification for the presidency his boasting ought to be tested against hard information about how his companies performed how they were managed and governed how shareholders and bondholders were treated how mr trump was compensated how he managed his tax burden and to what extent he has been a philanthropist unfortunately mr trumpâ s companies have been largely private in recent years shielding his accounts from public scrutiny

official said on tuesday the controversial tactic consists of firing a warning missile above or near an intended target to give residents time to flee before the real strike the israeli military used

our may deadline let me know if you have any flags and thanks v ejb friend i m going to be sticking around washington d c for a little longer once my time in the white house comes to an end and one of the things i m really looking forward to is the number of new voices that will be coming to this city when democrats take back the senate in november we all know how important it is to elect a democratic president who can build on the foundation we laid together over the past seven and a half years and who won t allow the progress we ve made to be rolled back but we ve also got to have a senate that can be a partner in the process there s still so much work to do for as far as we ve come there are still too many people who have a tough time getting a job or making sure their kids can get the kind of education they deserve the ability of women to determine their own health care decisions is threatened all across the country economic inequality has continued even as we have dramatically improved and stabilized the economy it s going to take new energy and ideas coming not only from the oval office but also from a senate full of leaders who are committed to rolling up their sleeves and getting to work folks like katie mcginty in pennsylvania ted strickland in ohio tammy duckworth in illinois and russ feingold in wisconsin these are just some of the great democrats we have running across the country and chances we have to pick up key seats and win back the senate but it s going to take all of us digging a little deeper and doing what we can to cross that finish line on november th can i count on you to pitch in or whatever you can before our end of month deadline at midnight to help us get there linksthanks for being part of this name we can t do it without you barack obama v sk friend in america it has always been and remains the duty of each generation to help close the gap between our ideals and the reality of the time and to make our country better off for those to come from our founding fathers who declared our independence to those who gave their lives in the fight to end slavery from the women who marched for their right to vote to the movement that grew out of stonewall to demand equality for the lgbt community this ideal has defined who we are as americans i m proud to say that we ve made some real strides over these past seven and a half years but the journey continues lgbt americans now have the right to marry whom they love and serve our country openly in the armed forces yet still face systematic legal forms of discrimination in certain states today women have made great strides forward in the workplace but are still not guaranteed the equal pay they deserve we ve come far but we still have work to do before we can consider the equality gap closed that s why i m asking you to support democrats who will keep us moving forward together linksi promise you that i ll always keep fighting name and i know that you will too but in order to protect our progress and keep making advances we need leaders in the white house and congress who will work for all of the people with no exceptions that means we need democrats so if you can pitch in or more before the deadline at midnight tonight to help democrats win big up and down the ballot on election day linkthanks for doing this today name barack obama v rae friend when i look back over the past seven years so much of what we fought for we did because it was common sense facing the threat of climate change it made sense to take major strides to combat it even while some refused to accept the scientific fact that it exists with millions of americans having to choose between paying their medical bills or putting a roof over their heads it seemed clear that we needed to make affordable health care available to every person in this country when we saw our hardworking neighbors struggling to get by doing what we could to raise the minimum wage and make paychecks more fair just made sense but what i have come to discover as i ve watched this election unfold is that that kind of common sense isn t all that common when it comes to the folks running in this election on the other side of the aisle because all of these things that we knew were the right things to do they want undone so if we want to protect everything we ve done and keep building on this foundation then it s also common sense that we have to elect democrats who will do just that and with our end of may deadline at midnight i m hoping you ll pitch in or more today to help linksthanks name barack obama"

political team sharing their analysis with you this week â please hold for mr trump â following donald trumpâ s commanding sweep of the indiana primary those words have been heard across the media landscape this week by countless producers and reporters as the presumptive republican nominee has made the rounds on television radio and print â and then made the rounds again he has been everywhere often seen sitting with his eyes narrowed across from a cable host at other times just a voice but the saturation has been more than a victory tour for trump it isâ indicative of how he plans to approach the general election campaign instead of relying on traditional methods of communication â paid advertising carefully chosen interviews corporate crafted facebook posts â he will be the medium and the message unpredictable and always around trumpâ s daily routine hundreds of requests come in through his trusted press aide hope hicks and they get piled on his desk trump likes to review actual printed documents he rifles through them â confirming this nixing that but that isnâ t the end he keeps close watch onâ cable news he monitors the headlines which are also printed out heâ ll call into one network while another sets up backstage and eventually he turns to twitter typing himself or dictating to an associate for democrats and republicans the obvious consequence of trumpâ s ubiquity is that regardless of what they want to focus on they will likely be forced to respond each day to the mogulâ s latest whim he looms each hour as a constant potential disturbance for better or for worse and shock he did on thursday when he generated a torrent of commentary â much of it cringing and harshly critical â with a controversial tweet that showed him smiling widely as he ate a taco bowl and praised hispanics â to get a sense of why trump is following an unusual playbook all his own the washington post spoke with longtime trump confidant roger stone a nixon loving bon vivant and ruthless strategist who has been at the billionaireâ s side for decades although he is not part of trumpâ s campaign stone said that trumpâ s manner forged in the manhattan tabloid and business wars of the s could weather more blows and brushbacks than the typical national politician and thus made the candidate more willing and able to use his persona as his most prominent campaign tool â trump is going to eschew everything the establishment and the press think he should be doing to have a total grassroots communications strategy â stone said in the interview â heâ ll be all over the media doing as many interviews as he can calling into radio shows and having wall to wall rallies that get broadcast on the cable channels â â remember â he added â those rallies also get you to dominate the local news so youâ re all over the local channels all over the national wall to wall and free â stone didnâ t always agree with trumpâ s tactics â i told him it couldnâ t work i was skeptical an adviser telling someone that you could win a presidential campaign by not spending much at all on ads by simply going on tv it was a historic calculation â he said â but he did it a blunt speaking style a repetition on three issues and you combine that with a sour and suffering electorate and it all worked â stone said â heâ s not programmable there was a time years ago i tried to put words in his mouth but it didnâ t take you can tell him concepts but he doesnâ t want to take someone elseâ s words heâ s not comfortable doing it heâ d rather watch the culture the news pick up what he can â â no one knew what he is going to do i still donâ t know what heâ ll do â stone said neither do most republicans and democrats the only guarantee he ll be on tv and nearly everywhere else â

republicans cover to separate themselves from the business mogul if it benefits them but it was yet another extraordinary moment in what has been a wildly unpredictable race ryanâ s comments deepened the divide in a party now facing a painful reckoning about trump his remarks broke a previous pledge to support the gop nominee and put him at odds with both senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and rnc chairman reince priebus who recently backed the real estate mogul his remarks offer a new way for like minded republicans to address trumpâ s pending nomination there has been growing anxiety among members in purple and blue districts marginal seats said rep peter t king â paul truly believes what heâ s saying itâ s personal and sincere but there is a political equation to all this he knows what the feeling is inside of the house as much as anyone â â trump is expected to visit washington next week to meet with lawmakers but there are no plans for trump to address the full house republican conference â a departure from tradition for both parties in which the presumptive nominees trek to capitol hill to meet with their respective caucuses in meetings hosted by the congressional leadership â meanwhile the rnc is working to set up a meeting between trump and ryan next week and chris christie said he would try to reach out to ryan and discuss his concerns â the tensions between trump and ryan go beyond temperament they have philosophical differences about the size and scope of government â ryan champions free trade agreements international military engagement and sweeping overhauls of social security and medicare whereas trump is an avowed opponent of recent trade deals foreign interventions and proposed changes to entitlement programs â â kasich aide john weaver praised the speaker for his stand it s not just ryan several big name republicans announced they could not yet anyway support their party s standard bearer and even more said

the House â€” A4A lobs tough talk back at Congress","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from heather caygle jennifer scholtes and lauren gardnerlawmakers eye terrorism in egyptair crash as details trickle in about the potential cause of the egyptair crash over the mediterranean fears are growing that the crash may have been an act of terrorism and lawmakers are taking a closer look at potential security gaps at airports in north africa our own jennifer scholtes spoke with house homeland security chairman mike mccaul who said he fears americans could be in danger if it was a bomb it probably would have been put on the plane in cairo or paris mccaul said that s my biggest concern cairo has flights into jfk and they re going to open another one at dulles as long as we have flights coming directly to the united states i think it s putting americans at risk insights from a recent codel mccaul and other members of congress actually visited north africa earlier this month jen writes that the delegation checked out transportation hubs including cairo international airport and found inadequate screening equipment and aviation workers that aren t thoroughly vetted passengers embarking from cairo are screened only by a magnetometer rather than full body scanners that can detect non metallic bombs and aviation workers aren t checked against u s intelligence information or databases the texas republican noted lawmakers have been pressuring tsa to send extra screening equipment to overseas ports where security is wanting but the agency has been slow to comply mccaul said he added that he plans to personally pester tsa administrator peter neffenger about his agency s timeline and also send an official letter to tsa there s been a six month delay in getting these full body scanner machines he said that needs to be expedited and then i think the vetting of their employees the latest updates egyptian officials also believe that terrorism is looking like an increasingly likely cause of the crash from the guardian egypt s aviation minister sherif fathi said he did not want to prematurely draw conclusions but added the possibility of having a different action or a terror attack is higher than the possibility of having a technical failure and from the washington post shortly after entering egyptian airspace the plane made sudden swerves and dropped from feet to feet said greece s defense minister panos kammenos the first turn was a sharp degree veer to the east then the plane made a full circular loop a degree turn kammenos said the national transportation safety board has said it will assist egypt as necessary in the investigation into the cause it s friday good morning

wavin this town goodbye all s quiet on the senate front after the senate voted to pass its transportation spending bill on thursday action is now headed to the house where lawmakers are tentatively expected to mark up their appropriations bill in the full committee next week the drama free final vote was reflective of a week with few of the theatrical snarls that mucked up the senate s energy and water appropriations bill earlier this month the one point of contention a controversial trucking measure on hours of service was included in the bill without much opposition a fact that road safety advocates say belies the trucking industry s cozy relationship with leaders in congress safety advocates lob accusations i m not going to reveal what members of congress have told me because i don t want to hurt their confidences but we know that this is a very traditional problem joan claybrook chairwoman of citizens for reliable and safe highways and former nhtsa administrator told reporters on a conference call earlier this week she said other members of congress didn t publicly fight the trucking provision out of fear that projects in their states wouldn t get funded we just know that the power of the subcommittee chairmen is very large and subcommittee chairwoman susan collins has been an advocate for years of anti safety provisions that the trucking industry wants from collins spokeswoman annie clark it is incredibly dishonest that this same safety group who criticized the last bill saying it would let truckers drive plus hours a week with a restart has come out in opposition to this cap clark said in an email adding that the group is rapidly losing credibility a a won t take it lying down as senators continue to accuse airlines of failing to pull their weight in the battle against airport security wait times they want airlines to waive checked bag fees for the summer airlines for america is throwing shade right back saying in a letter to sen dick durbin d ill that much of the blame for the lengthy lines lies with congress citing the bipartisan budget act of a a s nicholas calio said lawmakers diverted billion of passenger security fee revenue over years to pay for deficit reduction that decision has come home to roost calio said if congress wanted to take constructive and well justified action it would immediately pass legislation putting that money paid by airline passengers where it belongs hands off our baggage fees a a s statement also delivered a blow by blow rebuttal to the request for waived baggage fees the excessive airport security lines are a recent development whereas the model of charging customers for services they use and value like checking a bag has been in place since the organization wrote adding that tsa data shows that the number of checked bags has hardly changed in the past six years not only does the data not support a causal relationship between recent lines and baggage fees it would be illegal for airlines to jointly agree on any pricing policy including bag fees the organization said presented by norwegian air affordable fares to europe for every consumer that s the vision of norwegian with an billion order for new boeing airplanes not only does norwegian support the american economy it helps to create and support over american jobs in the united states get the facts openourskies com keeping up the drumbeat a group of federal worker unions are calling on the house to pass an faa reauthorization bill without privatization as the july deadline for the faa extension starts to loom a little closer a comprehensive faa reauthorization bill must be passed and signed into law by the president before the current extension expires on july wrote the group including the american federation of government employees the american federation of state county amp municipal employees and the national association of government employees to members of the house please work with your colleagues to move forward legislation that focuses on areas of consensus and does not privatize the air traffic control system ask and you shall receive metro released a copy of the final schedule for the yearlong safetrack project just hours after mt wondered out loud where it was coincidence definitely but that won t stop us from taking credit not much changed in the plan other than some shuffling around of the first phases of the part schedule and now the agency is looking at a june start date for the project s first safety surge from rep gerry connolly d va we cannot focus only on track and infrastructure repairs a complete system wide change in culture is necessary at all levels of metro the success of safetrack demands an open and transparent process but most important it will require a robust communications strategy that regularly informs the public as we move through this unprecedented maintenance and rebuilding plan a cautionary tale as one of public transit administrators crowded onto a conference call hosted by the american public transportation association on thursday washington metro general manager paul wiedefeld offered up his rail system as the perfect cautionary tale for what could happen to transit systems if managers don t address maintenance backlogs or receive the necessary funding to perform widespread maintenance work we have to catch up so that s what we ll do wiedefeld said talking about the widespread shutdowns planned for the safetrack plan for this infrastructure here we are the example of what occurs when you do not do that the deterioration of service and the need to take drastic action there but for the grace other public transit administrators seemed to emit a palpable air of relief that their systems plagued with their own maintenance problems to be sure had at least avoided the fate of washington s metro with its daylong emergency shutdown that made headlines nationwide dorval carter president of the chicago transit authority i think in many ways residents of d c are starting to experience the types of challenges that legacy systems have experienced for quite some time jeffrey knueppel general manager of septa in philadelphia had a heartening note after years of annual shutdowns to conduct maintenance he said the number of customer complaints about the service interruptions dropped dramatically our customers have learned to deal with the fact that we have this trolley tunnel blitz every year and customer complaints are going down and down and down every year because we promise to have fewer outages for the rest of the year it takes people time to adjust to the need to do these things regularly so here s hoping wmata riders as for apta the beleaguered transit advocacy organization is laying it on thick as it endeavors to prove to members that it s turning a new leaf after it was dumped by new york s metropolitan transportation authority and after the abrupt resignation of former president amp ceo michael melaniphy in an email to members this week apta outlined a slew of soul searching measures new task forces and upcoming meetings as well as a laundry list of dozens of public transit agencies lobbying groups and think tanks that apta said it had communicated with and presumably said they wouldn t abandon the advocacy organization in the near future they also highlighted potential new members including european railway manufacturer skoda transport usa hyper lolz the new york times allison arieff has a hilarious op ed on the elon musk affiliated hyperloop project can a

fundraiser","illinoisplaybook@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," am edtby natasha korecki nkorecki politico com natashakorecki with manuela tobias mtobias politico com manuelatobiasm good tuesday morning illinois in this unceasing state budget fight dems and a former republican governor have long accused gov bruce rauner of holding the budget hostage until the legislature approved his pro business anti union agenda now rauner has gone on tour accusing democrats of plotting to hold hostage k schools by demanding an immediate overhaul to the state s school funding system last year schools opened on time despite a budget stalemate because the democratic controlled legislature gave rauner a separate education spending plan that he signed he vetoed the rest of the budget this session rauner says democrats are scheming to keep schools from opening in the fall by demanding an immediate education funding formula overhaul that the governor calls a bailout for chicago schools not in madigan s playbook but a high level democrat close to house speaker mike madigan tells illinois playbook the speaker has no desire or intention of delaying school openings in the fall the discussion over a funding formula overhaul timed for this session has largely played out in the illinois senate the source says madigan believes the strategy of attempting to leverage school openings in order to pass a full state budget is a losing gambit saying it could be viewed as placing the interest of children on equal footing with even the most mundane of spending so what s the most likely legislative budget scenario similar to last year lawmakers are required to put forward a budget and it s likely be a democratic plan surprise rauner will have the option to veto it in its entirety as he did in with the exception of k or use reduction veto power to fund certain services that suffered over the last year like higher ed social services rape crisis centers senior services etc it s unclear how chicago schools would fare in such a scenario however that s something senate pres john cullerton sought to address in his formula change push cullerton says rauner s plan hurts schools cullerton s response to rauner on monday governor rauner said in his budget speech that no schools should lose funding and yet more than one third of the school districts in illinois lose money under his plan he would force schools across illinois to slash services and staff some might not be able to open or stay open next year chicago schools alone lose million governor rauner s plan cuts funding for schools in east st louis and naperville as well the quote a veteran democratic operative talking about the rauner era in springfield in the civil war we had a budget in the first war world we had

illinois is moving to intervene in a lawsuit filed last week against school district the dept of justice and the u s dept of education that seeks to reverse a decision allowing a transgender student limited access to a female locker room the aclu plans to announce later today its intended involvement in this latest round of the ongoing fight from aclu s director of communications and public policy edwin yohnka since the lawsuit and public announcement of the filing we have been in regular contact with our client student a and her family we have spoken out through the media regularly to point out the factual misstatements and hurtful personal attacks made against our client parents and students from district have expressed anger at the misstatements and factual inaccuracies advanced by those filing the lawsuit last week more have voiced concern about any effort to reverse policies that treat all students including those who are transgender in a fair and equitable way we believe that these voices from the school district deserve to be heard as part of this process in the coming days the aclu will file a motion with the court to intervene in the proceedings to represent a group of parents and students from district as well as others we look forward to working vigorously to defeat this attempt to turn back the clock and re install discrimination in the district schools

SPRINGFIELD","illinoisplaybook@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," am edtby natasha korecki nkorecki politico com natashakorecki and brianna gurciullo bgurciullo politico com brigurciullo good wednesday morning illinois there s buzz in springfield over another override attempt of the so called afscme arbitration bill hb that s after some labor reps rallied in the capital streets last week labor is mike madigan s fiercest ally in this protracted battle between the speaker and gov bruce rauner which is why we re likely to see another vote to override as early as today that s despite an expectation that it just doesn t have enough support to get it over the goal line with the may budget deadline creeping closer we ve yet to see a true budget compromise materialize though talks continue rauner s office is pushing hard for an agreed budget bill by that deadline and there was new talk tuesday night about a potential attempt involving some democrats to try to block a dem only unbalanced budget from passing in the house one that rauner is already swearing to veto the thinking is that by blocking a madigan drafted budget both sides would be forced to compromise and schools and social services would be funded on time it s a longshot to say the least given that a pre midnight roll call would need votes to pass and there s democrats in that chamber even if you subtract common nay dem votes like ken dunkin jack franks and scott drury any rebellion would have to be significant on education as we ve previously reported madigan wants schools to open on time and does not intend to hold up k school funding how many times can the same bill fail up next union arbitration veto override try two by illinois public radio s amanda vinicky democratic rep emanuel chris welch says he plans to call the measure for a vote i think the rally in springfield last week was very impressive and people are hearing that so we re going to put it on the board and see if the votes are there the legislation would require stalled contract talks to be settled by an arbitrator it s the second time rauner vetoed the idea house democrats previous attempt to override him fell three votes short the governor has called it the worst bill he s seen but unions say rauner is trying to force a strikenot liking it editorial boards from the peoria journal star to the daily herald have railed against the bill here s a sampling democratic bench not deep brown democrats short list of gov candidates is pretty short by chicago sun times mark brown sen dick durbin would rather guys like me not write about the possibility of him running for governor against bruce rauner in unfortunately for democrats the list of strong contenders is short after lisa madigan the list is less obvious state treasurer michael frerichs was elected in with rauner and appears to covet the governor s job but may not have the stature at this point frerichs moved into the treasurer s post from the illinois senate where several of his former colleagues daniel biss andy manar kwame raoul and heather steans adding whoever runs against rauner must be prepared to go up against the former private equity investor s bottomless pit of money and the monsoon of opposition research and negative attacks that rauner is capable of financing some insiders are estimating republicans may spend million in the next gubernatorial campaign dems wouldn t have to match that dollar for dollar but they d have to raise million to stay competitive that s why party insiders are looking to persuade big guns like durbin and to a lesser degree arne duncan lisa madigan would be a formidable opponent if her father agreed to step down as speaker if she were elected while brown notes other rising stars they d have a tough road ahead building name recognition and creating a strong organization while battling the rauner jabs brown s kicker seems appropriate here add it all up and what do you get a lot more

anna valencia was the striking brunette in an elle magazine spread on the politics of power dressing a year old assistant to mayor rahm emanuel she was interviewed and photographed in designer

lucas museum board of directors the former cps superintendent and u s secretary of education was named to the museum s board tuesday by nbc ward room s tom schuba lucas museum officials announced the

summer but some residents say they re afraid to use them especially lafollette park in the austin neighborhood amid much pomp and circumstance mayor emanuel announced the fourth annual night out in the parks program at lafollette park on the west side there will be free events across the city during the summer including five on the west side since the beginning of the year there have been shootings including four murders within several blocks of lafollette park one was on the corner of hirschburbs education department and district officials that allowed a transgender student who identifies as a girl to use the girls bathroom but monday s motion also took aim at the obama administration s sweeping guidance that transgender individuals are to enjoy the full spectrum of rights provided under title ix the federal law prohibiting sex based discrimination in schools and school activities and are to have their sex and therefore access to bathrooms and locker rooms defined by their gender identity boys who perceive themselves as girls are still biologically and anatomically male the motion argues it violates and humiliates the girls that a boy might see them undressed or that they might see him undressed and that they have to share such intimate settings as a locker room or restroom children are not guinea pigs and they should not be subjected to social experimentation to further political agendas as the price for a public education a title ix irony the motion makes arguments against the agreement and the administration s guidance that you ll hear plenty more of in the future namely that the obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority and has deprived students of their right to privacy but the plaintiffs attorneys are also trying to turn the administration s argument for the guidance against itself ironically the district violates title ix by doing what doe says it must do to comply with title ix the motion contends granting students access to restrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity creates a hostile environment and also provides unequal locker room facilities to girls put simply doe s redefinition of the term sex in title ix makes it impossible for schools to comply with the statute argonne looks to change the landscape of energy argonne launching first technology incubator for clean energy ideas

existing nuclear energy plants face early closure due to current economic and policy conditions providing more than of america s carbon free electricity existing state of the art nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean energy and carbon reduction goals in illinois our nuclear energy plants provide percent of the state s electricity and percent of our carbon free electricity the existing nuclear energy plants also contribute nearly billion to the economy and support approximately direct and indirect jobs but today illinois doesn t properly value these plants for their

"2016-05-02 22:49","Cruz scrambles to reverse his fortunes in Indiana's do-or-die primary","CNNNightcap@turner.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," cnn politics nightcapmay by eric bradner cruz scrambles to reverse his fortunes in do or die indiana ted cruz is getting the one on one shot he s always wanted against donald trump in indiana s tuesday primary but with polls showing trump ahead the texas senator could be poised to confront a harsh reality that has kept him from achieving his promise to unite the party his inability to reach economic conservatives in indiana cruz played hard to his socially conservative base but many of the indiana republicans he ll need tuesday are already exhausted by years of social battles making things even tougher the biggest pool of winnable voters suburban moderates in the doughnut counties around indianapolis didn t fall neatly into cruz s camp as he hoped they would after he struck a deal to have john kasich skip indiana the texas senator s efforts to address that weakness with economic conservatives many indiana republican operatives told nightcap fell short his economic message in indiana largely involved borrowing trumpâ s talking points about a localmanufacturer carrier that plans to shift jobs to mexico and he waited until monday to dispatch carly fiorina to work those suburbs cruz s closing message i trust the people of indiana to differentiate we are not a bitter angry petty bigoted people that is not america i reject that vision of america he said in osceola democrats clinton downplays indiana as sanders seeks win hillary clinton visited hammond and mishawaka last week and indianapolis on sunday but make no mistake her campaign is trying as hard as possible to look like one that s about to lose tuesday s primary clinton s camp didn t air a television ad in indiana it opened only five offices and she held just one rally and two invite only events spokesman brian fallon sought to portray indiana as a must win for bernie sanders on monday and pointed out that it is a largely white state saying he has spent millions of dollars in indiana we havenâ t been up at all here in indiana indiana is also a state in terms of tomorrow where demographically and the fact it is an open primary it resembles very closely a lot of the states where he has had his biggest wins why is clinton s camp so dour the michigan loss taught her aides something about expectations management but she defeated barack obama in indiana in it s no brush off state the democratic establishment here is behind her if her aides are convinced she can t win the question is why not a loss could suggest clinton hasn t yet turned the corner with white working class voters sanders boasted in fort wayne monday night about taking on the most powerful political organization in the country he said as he often does that his hopes ride on a large voter turnout and indiana could give it to him the state s primary is open which means independents can participate in it for sanders that s a welcome change from the last six east coast contests buzzingthe guy in blue face paint was really feeling the bern in fort wayne last call in west virginia clinton apologizes for coal miner remarks that s when clinton apologized saying her out of business remark was a misstatement taken out of context â what i was saying is that the way things are going now we will continue to lose jobs thatâ s what i meant to say â she said promising copley she d do whatever i can regardless of whether people are yelling at me and whether people are misrepresenting me or whether people are not looking at everything i say and taking something out of context thatâ s part of it i understand that but iâ m going to get up every single day trying to figure out what to do to help you provide the kind of future for your children that they deserve to have california gop unhappy with cleveland convention cheap seats eyes on why marco rubio hasn t endorsed ted cruz rubio s own explanation â at this point no itâ s not a year where endorsements matter very much â he told caputo â and no iâ ll just let it play itself out and work through it i really want to come back and focus on my work in the senate â cnn poll americans agree clinton trump headed for a faceoff the national republican numbers trump has support to ted cruz s and john kasich s among those not already backing trump nearly half say the gop front runner is their second choice of non trump voters say that if the candidate they support doesn t get the nomination trump is their backup about a third choose either kasich or cruz and say their second choice is someone other than the remaining three candidates trump also prompts the most enthusiasm of the remaining three candidates say they will be enthusiastic if he wins the nomination would feel that way about cruz and about kasich more say they would be dissatisfied or upset with cruz or kasich than say the same about trump on the democratic side clinton leads to bernie sanders about where the race stood in march straight up cruz didn t do anything even i would have helped her ok tipsyclosing timepaid

the koch industries headquarters for this week jk when you look back over the years over the last several cycles hundreds of millions of dollars in electoral politics what have you gotten for that what s been the return on that investment ck well i ve gotten a lot of abuse out of it jk am i hearing you correctly you think bill clinton was a better president than george w bush ck well in some ways in other ways i mean he wasn t an exemplar but as far as the growth of government the increase in spending it was much more under george bush when the republicans had it on restrictive regulations it was times under bush than it was under clinton don trump jr to jake tapper for cnn s state of the union taped in clarks summit pa ted cruz has no chance of winning this without bribing the delegates that s his game at this point ok he s mathematically eliminated but that s been his game from day one because he s not an appealing candidate to the general election voter so he ll try to get there he ll do this he ll lose more states than mitt romney because i can t name a single state that mitt lost that ted can possibly win so i think at this point the republican establishment would much rather just hand the things over to hillary hand the reins over to her let her run it because guess what there s no accountability in the party because everyone s in on the same thing all their job is to do is to protect the little cliques that they ve formed to keep the big paychecks rolling from their special interests and that s the same thing with the delegate process that we re seeing today bernie sanders on meet the press chuck todd i have quite some interesting numbers here so of the states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries sixteen of those states have been won by hillary clinton not by you why sanders well because poor people don t vote i mean that s just a fact mrs obama gave a fiery fascinating defense of her husband and his presidency yesterday in her commencement address at jackson state university a historically black university in jackson miss w hen i hear words like dignity and excellence i think about my husband applause see i know i m biased and i do think he s cute too applause but as i ve walked this journey with barack i ve gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray what it means to set your eyes on the horizon to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you i have seen how no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment barack always stays the course applause and then there s the countless times when that language gets personal and is directed at my husband charges that he doesn t love our country the time he was called a liar in front of a joint session of congress the nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in god i n light of today s hour news cycle in this era where our facebook feeds are limited to the voices of folks who think exactly like we do and our tvs and radios are exclusively tuned in to those who tell us only what we want to hear it s not surprising that our disagreements have become more personal more intense i wish i could say otherwise graduates but the question isn t whether you re going to come face to face with these issues the question is how you re going to respond when you do a re you going to take a deep breath straighten your shoulders lift up your head and do what barack obama has always done as he says when they go low i go high applause that s the choice barack and i have made that s what has kept us sane over the years we simply do not allow space in our hearts minds or souls for darkness instead we choose faith faith in ourselves in the power

care requirements for the first time in more than a decade the pro health care team plucked out five key takeaways for the first time each state must create its own network adequacy standards for private medicaid plans telemedicine can play a role more for pros medicaid managed care plans are now subject to a national medical loss ratio standard of at least percent although it doesn t impose payment penalties if plans spend less than that share of premiums on care more for pros the final rule could expand access to care for mentally ill patients by easing restrictions on reimbursements at certain facilities more for pros cms will add a quality rating system for private medicaid and chip plans the program is expected to be similar to one utilized for medicare advantage plans the agency plans to implement the rating system for medicaid plans over five years and will seek feedback on its proposed methodology before moving ahead cms will prohibit states from making certain supplemental payments to hospitals and other providers that serve medicaid managed care enrollees a move that hospitals said was disappointing instead states and medicaid plans must transition to systems where the payment structure is linked to delivered services or quality with cms allowing a multi year transition period what officials are saying these improvements modernize the way these managed care health plans operate so that medicaid and chip continue to provide cost effective high quality care to consumers cms acting administrator andy slavitt and deputy administrator vikki wachino write in a blog

there is someone my boss could should call i know he would really like to express his appreciation to the president below are items we discussed congressman nadler would definitely like to join the president for the dnc fundraiser in nyc on june and any words of support at the event would be greatly appreciated we have drafted an endorsement as well as a script that we would like to send across please direct where to send for approval we would like to use a photo of the congressman with the president in some of our materials wondering if we could use the photograph taken last summer when congressman nadler had a meeting in the oval office i can direct you to the specific photo we have not used it on the official side so should be clear to use it as part of the campaign also if there will be hires photos from the dnc event in june we would like to be able use them for the campaign we want to get an email blast from the dccc before june that has a message of support from the president wondering if this is a possibility and if we could draft something for your approval thanks again for all your help and let me know if there is anything more i can do to move things forward

KaplanJ@dnc.org"," thanks cynthia trying to make sure that wednesday will work on our end we might go up against the politico event but i think they might be a late afternoon event we could make ours brunch â will be putting together a formal invitation with as many details as we have and sending that along to jordan and claireplease see sen gillibrand s positive response to the convention idea co hosted by wlf off the sidelines and hopefully ahmal amp george clooney kirsten g is willing to move forward and based on the original response from the clooneys thru our mutual friend jae kim we think there s a real chance it can happen with all principals taking part to do please assemble a fact sheet on the event from the dnc including all details known at this time note ref timing carol amp i spoke with emily berman and stefanie conahan kirsten s staff today and based on kirsten s convention schedule we would need to have the event wednesday not tuesday approximately am noon so as to avoid the emily s list event that afternoon at pm that is the only change from what was originally outlined not yet knowing the clooneys schedule of course we look forward to hearing from you asap thanks cynthia and carol forwarded message cynthiathanks for the great idea i don t get to the convention until later tuesday night but emily and stefanie will work with you on timing and other arrangements can t wait kirsten gillibrand hello kirsten i hope all s well with you even with the current tumultuous political landscape surrounding us all carol pensky and i send you our warm personal wishes with this message on a conference call with the dnc last week concerning ideas for wlf s presence at the philadelphia convention we all discussed the importance of wlf and also of off the sidelines being highlighted there during a prime daytime slot we also thought it should not be thru a fundraising event trusting that your plans are still open for the convention we would like to propose holding a joint event with ots and wlf possibly a festive reception to be underwritten by a woman s magazine or other suitable sponsor tuesday afternoon july th pm we would focus on you as the special star attraction of this event the idea makes complete sense to us since you are the member of congress who has done the absolute most for democratic women candidates the past several cycles the event would give you a platform to highlight your efforts as well as include a wlf message pointing out the importance of women s involvement in the democratic party and serving as the women s host for the dnc fyi emily s list and emerge are also holding gatherings that week emily on wednesday pm and emerge on tuesday pm note since drafting the above paragraphs last friday a new important potential scenario developed over the weekend concerning the interest and availability of amahl and george clooney in joining this event amahl and george said they met you were most impressed with you as a senator and a leader and would enjoy being associated with you at the convention as well the above info came back to me over the weekend from jae kim a former new york wlf and wlfn member who now lives in vancouver jae has been best friends with amahl for years bridesmaid at her wedding etc jae is also a good friend of mine someone i mentored in the years she lived in nyc while discussing wlf s convention plans with jae last friday i mentioned the wlf ots idea then we digressed to the possibility of the clooneys attending the convention as a result she asked if it was acceptable to call amahl and george over the weekend to see whether they were attending the convention mention the possibility of ots and wlf joining together that week and see what their plans were jae spoke to them saturday and as a result they suggested the following george clooney has been invited to speak at the convention hasn t accepted yet but feels it s very important this year and is tending toward accepting and if he does accept then both of them would like to do a joint event with you ots and wlf jae explained the importance of wlf s role in organizing women thru the democratic party and amahl and george quickly agreed with the idea i have asked the dnc to prepare a fact sheet about the potential event to be emailed to you and to the clooney s personal assistant this week finally carol and i realize we have taken a special friend advantage by contacting you directly indeed you are a special friend and it will be followed up by the official invitation from the dnc chair after our informal exploration of these ideas we hope this plan holds a great appeal to you as well we think it would make a big impression on women at the convention and beyond and we look forward to hearing from you thanks kirsten

the resources they need to win linksseriously name thank you michelleâ v rae â friend â in the midst of this hectic election cycle and the last few months of barackâ s time in office it can be easy to lose sight of how far weâ ve come so i want you to take a minute to think back on how our last few years together have been an ongoing adventure filled with accomplishments â shining examples of what we can achieve when we put our values into practice then i want to issue you this challenge name to keep dreaming of new heights challenging old assumptions thinking big things and having the confidence that we can keep making life better for future generations and electing democrats who share our values in november is how weâ ll reach those goals so with our end of month deadline coming up i need you to pitch in or more today because when we work together we can make anything happen linksthank you tremendously michelle vpotus â v ejb â friend going into this year barack told all of us that he planned to make the most of every minute he had left as president and that in our team was going to leave it all out on the field and name i canâ t tell you how glad i am that youâ re on this team lt link gt because as weâ ve seen in and again in weâ ve got what it takes to win thanks to the passion and determination of grassroots supporters like you who got us across the finish line twice and who are going to get us there again this november lt link gt we had our work cut out for us when we took office in but look at where we are now iâ ve said it before and iâ ll say it a hundred times more america is better positioned than any country in the world to own the st century but only if we have leaders with the vision to see it through and supporters who understand that their work doesnâ t end at the ballot box on election day it takes us going out into our communities and fighting each and every day for the kind of change we want to see and make no mistake one year from now youâ re going to see me right there along with you another average joe who wants to make sure my leaders in washington are looking out for my family and neighbors all of this is why i am ready to work as hard as i can to make sure we elect democrats up and down the ballot this year because i know when it comes to giving everyone a fair shake and a fair shot our party has it right and we have some pretty terrific candidates to get behind and name weâ re counting on folks like you to make sure the white house stays in good hands and our next democratic president has a functional congress to work with we have an important deadline coming up at the end of this month name can i count on you to step up linkthanks a lot name i really mean it joeâ v jgr â i was elected to congress in abortion was illegal in the united states folks were fighting tooth and nail for the most basic rights for our lgbt brothers and sisters and the battle to confront the effects climate change had barely begun to take place now in i marvel at how far we ve come i know i don t have to tell you name the progress we ve made in women s rights civil rights and environmental safety has been monumental but we haven t won these battles yet we ve got so much more work to do because the fact is there are folks in this country who see the progress we ve made but still want to take us backwards and i just can t abide by that thinking we ve done too much and made a difference in too many people s lives i ve seen it you ve seen it we ve got to keep going forward today i m asking you to join the fight to move forward pitch in or whatever you can before the end of the month and help elect democrats who share our values linksthanks name thanks for every single moment that you re fighting this good fight it means so much joeâ v ch â friend every day since i became a public servant more than years ago iâ ve woken up in the morning with a single thought what can i do on this day to make a difference in peopleâ s lives and that single thought has been a guiding principle in all the work that we ve done together name from fighting to close the gender wage gap to recognizing that climate change is the most consequential issue of our time and taking steps to combat it to working to curb the gun violence that leaves families and communities heartbroken weâ re doing everything we can to make life a little better for folks in every corner of this country and watching this election unfold itâ s become very clear that the guys who want to come into the white house when barack and i leave are folks who continue to deny the science of climate change who think paycheck fairness is a waste of time who donâ t even want to consider regulations that could make it harder for guns to wind up in the hands of people who shouldnâ t have them and name we canâ t afford to have leaders like that take us in the wrong directions so weâ ve got to elect democrats name so that we can continue this fight and keep doing the work that matters before tomorrow nightâ s fundraising deadline can you pitch in start a monthly donation of or whatever you can to help make that happen linksthanks name we can win this one and keep moving this country forward if we keep working together joe"

"2016-05-09 07:24","Trump's empty administration","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," trump s empty administrationby darren samuelsohn and ben white am edttop republican political leaders aren t the only ones shunning their party s presidential nominee a vast number of highly skilled managers and policy experts veterans of recent gop administrations who would normally be expected to fill key positions for a new white house are also vowing to sit out a donald trump presidency and while the failure of the two presidents bush or house speaker paul ryan to endorse the presumptive nominee carries political consequences the absence of policy veterans in a new administration would have a substantive effect on the running of government politico interviewed nearly five dozen republicans over the past two weeks people with experience working in government and who understand how congress can enact or shred a new president s agenda and heard the same sentiment expressed repeatedly if trump doesn t change his tune or extend much longer olive branches many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less experienced competitors i would never serve in a trump administration said james capretta a former office of management and budget official under george w bush the person at the top is unfit for the presidency he s made that very clear with his behavior added matt mcdonald another bush omb veteran i wouldn t vote for trump much less work for him i don t agree with half his ideas and the other half i don t really believe what he said one former republican official who worked in the environmental protection agency put it this way you d have to worry about your future career and the way you re perceived in these things you just kind of think of how he deals with people would you really want to work for him the lack of interest in serving trump extends from the energy and financial services sectors to defense and foreign policy and while the reluctance of former officials to join a trump administration may spark a good riddance response from the candidate himself the absence of experienced professionals at the assistant secretary level could have profound consequences on the government the bottom line is trump will be able to fill these jobs because there is a whole class of people who want these titles so badly it doesn t matter who is president said a former senior george w bush administration official but these are b or c level people they are honorable but not very good the a level people and there are not that many of them to begin with mostly don t want to work for trump he will cut the a level bench of available policy talent at least in half if not more building an administration from scratch requires filling more than high level federal jobs starting with a cabinet and trickling down to the scores of deputies undersecretaries and assistant administrators who actually make the u s government tick it s a herculean task for any new president but would perhaps especially be so for trump who has taken anti washington campaigning to new heights this makes trump s challenge of uniting the republican party urgent and difficult the current and former lawmakers former gop administration officials policy experts and presidential transition veterans who spoke with politico agreed that trump will need to display a much more serious level of policy understanding and statesmanship over the next six months to demonstrate he s the kind of boss they would really want to work for as he s cemented his role as the gop s presumptive nominee trump has taken initial steps toward building a white house transition plan the new york times reported on friday that trump had put his son in law jared kushner in charge of a team that would include campaign manager corey lewandowski and senior adviser paul manafort trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks who did not respond to requests for comment for this story told the times that leaders of their transition team would be announced in the coming weeks several republican issue experts confirmed they ve also recently started helping the campaign build out its knowledge base and outreach to the party s policy experts working in tandem with sen jeff sessions r ala the first senator to endorse trump for example john mashburn a former chief of staff to sen thom tillis r n c just started with the trump campaign as policy director joining longtime sessions aide stephen miller another senior policy adviser but trump s initial steps to get ready to govern don t compare with where republicans were four years ago on the transition front by the late spring of mitt romney was already starting to vet possible cabinet members as well as people willing to serve in other senior political slots even marco rubio and jeb bush in the early stages of the race were collecting the names of potential administration hires on friday president barack obama signed an executive order that launches his end of the transition process including briefings on certain issues for the presidential candidates it s a move that follows up on a law he signed in march that requires a sitting administration to begin planning the hand over to a new administration six months before the november election former utah gov mike leavitt whose personal advocacy on the transition planning issue led congress to name the new law in part after him wrote in an email that this year s presidential nominees must start planning too given there are less than days between the election and inauguration this is not a political thing said leavitt who handled romney s transition planning and served under george w bush as an epa administrator and also secretary at the department of health and human services it s a serious obligation a source familiar with trump s thinking explained that the billionaire businessman was reluctant to add new layers of policy experts now feeling it would only muddy his populist message that has been hyperfocused on illegal immigration trade and fighting islamic extremists he doesn t want to waste time on policy and thinks it would make him less effective on the stump the trump source said it won t be until after he is elected but before he s inaugurated that he will figure out exactly what he is going to do and who he is going to try to hire trump said as much in a recent interview with the new york times telling the newspaper he is thinking about his potential appointments to be u s ambassador to the united nations and secretaries of defense and treasury but i think more about winning first he said as he considers who he d want on his team the manhattan billionaire has spoken about following in the footsteps of abraham lincoln by tapping some of his republican rivals from chris christie and ben carson to marco rubio and john kasich as cabinet members or even for a running mate in an interview with cnn last week trump said he may put carson and christie on a committee to vet possible vice presidents and other administration officials but even people who have been mentioned by the candidate himself as potential hires are reluctant to engage in a discussion of whether they would want to serve in his administration rubio for example sidestepped several questions in late april about life in a possible trump administration either for himself or any other republicans i ve not thought about it and i don t have a thoughtful answer he told politico i just haven t spent any time thinking about what you re asking me at treasury which plays a lead role on fiscal and tax policy the only candidate regularly mentioned by trump is long time wall street activist investor carl icahn but the year old icahn has repeatedly said he doesn t want the job and few who follow these jobs closely think trump would even try to persuade him you can t send an year old wall street guy to be treasury secretary one top former republican white house official said it s not going to be carl icahn you can have an old wall street guy as trade representative or at commerce or something but not treasury it doesn t work trump could still look to wall street for a treasury secretary perhaps from the private equity industry a name often mentioned to replace jack lew is blackstone group chief executive stephen schwarzman a person close to schwarzman described him as a great choice for trump trump has also mentioned kkr co founder and co ceo henry kravis as a possible treasury secretary but kravis has said he s not interested trump also name dropped former ge ceo jack welch for treasury welch has also said he does not want the job tennessee sen bob corker who has worked extensively on financial issues including reforming the housing finance system has also been mentioned for treasury as well as for secretary of state one other name mentioned by several republicans as a possible trump treasury secretary is glenn hubbard currently dean of the columbia university graduate school of business hubbard served in top economic jobs in both bush administrations he advised jeb bush before the former florida governor dropped out of the campaign trump would certainly not be hubbard s first choice of presidents to serve people who know him said but he might agree if implored by trump to help run economic policy including a big tax rewrite hubbard s top issue hubbard did not respond to a request for comment trump s biggest challenge in attracting talent however is trump himself according to dozens of republican policy specialists the real estate billionaire has run a presidential campaign heavy on insults and devoid of the kinds of substantive policy ideas that gop issue experts look to for signs of what they d be working on if they joined his government i think it would be very hard to help him said presidential historian stephen hess a former aide to presidents dwight d eisenhower and richard m nixon he of all the candidates i have ever known is the most profoundly ignorant of the presidency i don t know quite how you deal with that once you get to the point when you are supposed to be advising him sure enough the same motivations behind the nevertrump movement that has been working to block the billionaire s path to the gop nomination also apply to many of the republican policy wonks who have no plans to ever send trump their rã sumã s after trump became the presumptive nominee with his victory in indiana last tuesday keith hennessey who led george w bush s national economic council turned to twitter to repost a link to a recent blog post that declared his firm opposition complete with a lengthy takedown of the billionaire s evolving policy views this is not a tough call hennessey wrote in march donald trump is an ignorant unprincipled amoral policy lightweight opposed to free market capitalism and limited government trump s personnel challenges also threaten to undermine some of the most ambitious parts of his agenda several officials who served in george w bush s treasury department and at the federal reserve during the most recent gop administration predicted a president trump would have trouble attracting a list talent to help him execute a plan to completely rewrite an uncompetitive u s corporate tax code while also addressing a national debt nearing trillion not only will i not work for trump i ll continue to use my voice to actively oppose him trump isn t merely distasteful or wrong on policy he s a danger to the country said tony fratto a former white house and treasury official under george w bush he is truly monstrous anyone who thinks he s going to moderate or become reasonable once he achieves power is insane lanhee chen who served as romney s policy director and then took on a senior advising role with rubio in declined to comment when asked about his willingness to serve under trump but he did admit that trump faces an uphill climb attracting experienced talent my view is it would be very challenging for a lot of mainstream policy folks to envision working in an administration for somebody who has said some of the things trump has said during the campaign chen said while other republicans who might serve in senior economic and financial regulatory posts said they would have no interest in joining a trump administration some did concede they might take the chance in part out of a sense of duty to try and keep trump from doing any real damage i think over time he will be able to fill those jobs but it will not be easy at the start said one senior republican who has been mentioned for at least two cabinet posts he will have to surround himself with people who know what they are doing and in a way it may be a great opportunity for people who really want to make a difference because he s going to come in without a set of people already around him or any strong preconceived notions of what to do liza wright who ran the bush white house s personnel shop from to said she expects the number of republican policy experts willing to work for trump to grow if the party establishment rallies around him i think personal ambition is going to overcome a lot of angst and principle over whether they fundamentally support trump wright said i ve seen that a lot where people want that bullet point on a rã sumã but there s still the question of whether trump would want to surround himself with veterans of past administrations the presumptive nominee is just as dismissive of recognized policy area experts as they are of him during a foreign policy address last month in washington trump signaled he had little interest in many of the bush administration veterans who have been busy during the obama era making money at law firms on k street and in academia since leaving their government jobs many more than a decade ago we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don t know what they re doing even though they may look awfully good writing in the new york times or being watched on television trump said and certainly if trump takes over the white house in january he will hire enough people to keep agencies running indeed as he shifts toward the general election and alters his gop primary focused rhetoric the party establishment s animosity toward its standard bearer could lessen there s no doubt in my mind that people will be sending rã sumã s in said rep tom marino a pennsylvania republican and early trump supporter on capitol hill who predicted the frenzy for administration jobs would kick in in earnest at the conclusion of the cycle talking to people who know people it will occur things change after the election some of the elected gop officials who have endorsed the billionaire s campaign said they would consider joining the administration even if it meant leaving their capitol hill positions california gop rep duncan hunter a former marine officer in afghanistan and iraq wouldn t rule out working at a trump led pentagon we ll see he said in an interview i m only of course i d be interested replied north dakota rep kevin cramer who endorsed trump in april and was mentioned in a recent story in the hill as a possible energy secretary would i love to shape a team yes i d love to george david banks a former george w bush environmental aide who served at the white house and state department also raised his hand signaling a willingness to serve his party s presumptive nominee i would be honored to work for a trump white house he said adding that he expected to see many of his gop colleagues lobby for administration jobs if the republican wins the general election but the real question is how many of them would mr trump actually hire indeed many of trump s allies insist he will have no problem finding enough people to work for him in government the only question will be weeding out the predictable candidates and choosing the best people to do the job there are people who make a career out of glomming on or latching on to whoever it is in power hunter predicted those people will try to latch on as soon as possible to whoever they think is going to win bryan bender and eli stokols contributed to this report to view online "

wapo abc pollâ â if you re having trouble reading this â click here lt view url gt donald trump arrives for a meeting with henry kissinger in new york city last week â reuters brendan mcdermid the big idea but our national poll finds that these independent voters are profoundly troubled by trumpâ s refusal to release his tax returns a sign of the issueâ s potential potency both candidates are viewed more unfavorably than favorably by double digits interestingly one of the few issues that works to trumpâ s advantage right now is tax policy trump is trying to become the first major party nominee in years not to release his returns his excuses continue to evolve in he said heâ d share his tax returns if barack obama released his birth certificate the president did the donald did not follow through in trump criticized mitt romney for trying to keep his returns private romney eventually relented this january trump declared he was ready to release his returns but after winning in several primaries the business mogul clarified that he wonâ t release them until after the irs finishes auditing him something which raises its own host of questions then trump claimed thereâ s nothing to learn from the filings next he invoked personal privacy â none of your business â heâ s said a few times after a backlash he reiterated that he wants to release them but cannot heâ s bragged about paying as little as possible which heâ s called â the american way â but he also routinely attacks corporations for using loopholes to â get away with murderâ in his stump speech trump told the post last week that he has paid â substantialâ taxes but declined to provide specifics he reiterated that he tries â very hard to pay as little tax as possibleâ â one of the reasons is because the government takes your money and wastes it in the middle east and all over the place â four times donald trump told reporters it s none of your business trolling trump hillary suggested yesterday that her opponent is not releasing the filings because heâ s not as successful as he claims â he goes around talking about make america great â clinton said on â meet the press â â you know that means paying for our military that means paying for our roads that means paying for the va if you ve got someone running for president who is afraid to release his tax returns because it will expose the fact that he pays no federal income tax that s a big problem â trump tweetedâ thisâ image of himselfâ signing his tax return â but that s it â trump presidential campaign via ap why the tax returns are a great wedge issue for hrc helps make the case that trump is not â on your side â our polling shows that trump is overwhelmingly seen as the candidate whose economic policies would help the rich get richer hillary can use the tax secrecy issue to say that heâ s looking out for himself not the middle class neutralizes clintonâ s own secrecy problem recall how hard bernie sanders has hit her for not releasing the transcripts of her speeches to goldman sachs that has no teeth in a general election if trump is keeping his taxes private other key numbers from our new pollâ in a sign that the base is coming home trump wins percent of self identified republicans while percent of registered republicans say trumpâ s views do not reflect the core values of the party â most support him anyway percent of u s adults say trump is not qualified to be president percent say clinton is qualified more than in say trump does not show enough respect to people with whom he disagrees percent of adults say it is a major problem but percent of that overall group still support him percent of americans want a third party option mitt romney pulls percent as an independent in a three way match up

turnberry resolves litigation on potential urban development boundary expansion site turnberry associates has resolved litigation over a property near doral where it hopes to expand the county s urban development boundary florida asset resolution group an affiliate of fort lauderdale based bbx capital nyse bbx filed a lawsuit in june against turnberry doral development jeffrey soffer and jacquelyn soffer over a million mortgage that was originated by bankatlantic the lawsuit was not a foreclosure but sought to force the borrowers to repay the loan south florida business journal january settlement appears likely in fontainebleau las vegas bankruptcy case fontainebleau las vegas the soffers are on the verge of settling with creditors over the debacle once known as the fontainebleau las vegas a still skeletal billion high rise in sin city that ranks as one of the biggest busts of the u s real estate crisis a federal bankruptcy judge in miami said wednesday he was inclined to approve a million settlement that would pay contractors on the failed casino tower about cents on the dollar contractors would divvy up about million for a total claims pool of million but which a creditor lawyer said would probably end up closer to million once negotiations are finished the money will be paid out to creditors and lawyers in arbitration or by court order a process that could add another year or two onto a case that began with a chapter bankruptcy filing in june construction lenders would recoup about million i certainly have sympathy for all of the people who have money coming to them and seem to have been waiting forever judge a jay cristol told an audience about lawyers half of them participating by speaker phone at an afternoon hearing in downtown miami the settlement money would come from the million in sale proceeds paid by corporate raider carl icahn when he bought the unfinished tower out of bankruptcy in the money has been in an frozen escrow account pending the bankruptcy outcome an additional million would come from title companies that backed the project as well as from a million completion guarantee funded by jeff soffer and his sister jacquelyn the brother and sister team run the family s real estate firm turnberry which got its start with the creation of aventura and now includes both the aventura mall and the fontainebleau miami beach the story fontainebleau vegas is described in court papers as essentially a tear down valuable for its land on the north end of the strip but burdened by a five year old unfinished tower that icahn may demolish while judge cristol said the settlement would probably meet his approval he said he would consider written objections by a las vegas contractor who wanted its million lawsuit against jeff soffer protected from the settlement a million settlement by mr soffer to get out of all the problems he is currently facing is not a large amount said henry marinello a miami lawyer representing the tracy and ryder landscape inc a large nevada based landscaping contractor the settlement would end claims by lenders and contractors in the bankruptcy case but the soffers still face litigation involving the fontainebleau vegas jeff soffer the lead developer in both fontainebleau projects has blamed the vegas debacle on lehman brothers cutting off funds after it collapsed in followed by some of the nation s top banks holding back about million in construction funds slated for completing the project but lenders accused soffer and his development team at turnberry of mismanagement and over spending allegations repeated by the bankruptcy trustee in a separate suit seeking damages from soffer and his top executives that litigation is still pending and will not be covered by the settlement the soffers did not attend the hearing jeff soffer presided over fontainebleau vegas and put in million cash collateral for the million completion guarantee before the project started in his sister became part of the guarantee when she bought a judgment from a lender that had successfully sued to force jeff to pay the remaining million both soffers claimed they should get the money back since the funds could only be used to complete a project that now had no hope of being finished the two essentially surrendered their claims to the money as part of the settlement said mario romine general counsel for turnberry associates soneet kapila a fort lauderdale accountant appointed as bankruptcy trustee for the case blamed the four years leading up to the a settlement on the fact that the case is one of the most complicated ever to be heard in south florida when it is high level and sophisticated litigation there are a lot of things to resolve he said it s the nature of it the miami herald november previously resolved issues by dnc vet com soffers settle dispute with bank over las vegas fontainebleau deutsche bank trust co americas and a soffer family partnership have apparently resolved a million dispute regarding the fontainebleau las vegas jacquelyn soffer has been substituted as the plaintiff for deutsche bank in the case which would give her the right to collect million in principal in interest plus attorneys fees in new york state supreme court the billion project was never completed soffer s brother jeffrey was described by deutsche bank as being in control of the partnership and named as a defendant jacquelyn soffer was not lenders including bankrupt lehman brothers have filed lawsuits alleging jeff soffer still owes hundreds of millions for personal guarantees on financing for the stalled hotel casino resort complex in las vegas which carl icahn purchased for million in january the soffer family and turnberry also have counterclaims against the las vegas resort s lenders the counterclaims which use details from an examiner s report about the collapse of lehman said lehman hid its true financial condition jeff soffer signed a settlement agreement with the bank in january but the counterclaims are still pending as part of the agreement deutsche bank assigned to jackie soffer all of its rights title and interest in the causes of action actually asserted in this action including the right to have judgment entered against the defendants herein a logical question is why would a bank substitute a defendant s sister in collecting the judgement attempts to obtain an explanation regarding the matter from the soffers or their spokesman david satterfield were not successful by deadline other attorneys offered several possible reasons jackie soffer might have reached a lower settlement figure with the bank the family might have wanted to equitably share the financial impact the switch might be part of a broader legal strategy regarding debts related to the las vegas resort the judgment for jackie soffer was registered with the new york state supreme court and signed by judge judith gische on feb the fontainebleau las vegas filed for bankruptcy in jeff soffer lenders and others involved in the project suffered losses but lehman brothers alleges soffer still owes it for losses on certain loans south florida business journal march new york investors getting turnberry s davie commons it looks like aventura based turnberry associates is giving up control of its controversial davie commons

online auction march new york real estate investor gill li said jacquelyn soffer has a small minority ownership in kbnp he is among several new york investors who are partners in that company the soffers are cooperating in the foreclosure action south florida business journal february soffer s spending draws fire in suit a bitter legal fight has erupted between one of south florida s biggest business celebrities jeffrey soffer of the turnberry companies and bruce weiner a former ceo of turnberry residential lp the litigation has turned nasty with weiner alleging that soffer siphoned millions of dollars from turnberry companies for upkeep of his baronial lifestyle the suit is the latest in a string of legal and financial entanglements for soffer who was forced to abandon his largest project the billion fontainebleau las vegas in a bankruptcy soffer is famous for flashy spending driving racecars and dating supermodels including elle macpherson weiner takes direct aim at those spending habits in his lawsuit among the dramatic examples of jeff soffer s abuse was a multimillion dollar th birthday he threw for himself that was headlined by a live performance by prince weiner alleges in his complaint tabloids estimated the party alone cost million soffer fired the first shot in the battle after firing weiner in may he alleged in miami dade county circuit court that weiner betrayed turnberry by privately negotiating to provide development services to orlando based starwood vacation ownership on its new project the st regis bal harbor resort turnberry alleged that weiner as ceo of turnberry residential violated his fiduciary duties as an officer by forming a new company bal star llc and arranging the starwood deal turnberry alleged weiner had the obligation to bring the st regis deal to them also named in the suit is robert vollrath turnberry s former cfo we ve alleged that turnberry at this point owns the starwood deal turnberry attorney michael olin said turnberry made these guys very wealthy people at the end of the day they went off on their own and took the starwood deal for themselves they violated all their fiduciary duties to their employer circuit judge gill freeman rejected turnberry s first complaint telling attorneys it was not clear enough about the corporate structure of the turnberry companies and what duties weiner and vollrath owed to them the company is preparing to refile the suit in the meantime weiner filed his own counterclaim against turnberry naming soffer and his sister jacquelyn soffer in the suit fort lauderdale lawyer tom angelo is one of weiner s attorneys their filing the lawsuit necessitated bruce filing his counterclaim angelo said bruce felt it was very unfortunate given the fact he was there years working with them according to weiner s lawsuit he was a percent owner of turnberry residential the suit says he and the soffers took out loans from turnberry residential when it was financed in with a million loan and credit line from prudential real estate investors weiner s lawsuit says he repaid his loan of million within the required two years but he alleges that jeffrey soffer took out million and jacquelyn soffer took out million and that the two combined failed to repay a combined million by the end of according to weiner s suit the soffers then caused the company to reclassify the loans as distributions without offering weiner the same privilege weiner alleges he should have received percent of that million distribution weiner also alleges he is still owed money from commissions on sales at turnberry s rosslyn a large luxury condominium in arlington va with views of the washington monument olin scoffed at the notion that turnberry owes any money to weiner he s out to lunch he said of weiner s claims the turnberry complaint alleges that weiner and vollrath were so wrapped up in their starwood plans that they allowed costly delays at the rosslyn project despite the litigation turnberry s website still referred to weiner as the ceo of turnberry residential on feb it calls weiner a driving force in the development and sales of more than homes and a highly regarded real estate development sales and marketing executive turnberry s media office said in an e mail that it does not comment on litigation angelo said weiner was not bound by any non compete clause in fact he had a contract as a partner that specifically allowed him to do business outside of turnberry weiner s counterclaim alleges that jacquelyn soffer twice ordered audits of funds she and her brother received and that the audits determined weiner should have also received distributions the suit does not elaborate on jacquelyn soffer s motive for the audits or the results of the audits miami real estate consultant lewis goodkin said turnberry has so far weathered the economic downturn but the end of the current real estate crisis is proving a bitter chapter for many similar companies relationships like theirs usually don t go sour until the market goes sour goodkin said that s the kind of mess that we see people get into south florida business journal february banks target soffers vegas center the soffer family is facing a legal fight to retain control over one of its las vegas projects lenders are trying to foreclose on town square las vegas the massive mixed use retail and office project the soffers opened in late just as the economy headed into a tailspin bank of nova scotia this week asked a new york judge in the lehman brothers holdings bankruptcy case to allow it to foreclose on town square the bank heads a group of lenders that made a million construction loan to an affiliate of the aventura based turnberry associates headed by siblings jeff and jackie soffer lehman is involved because it made a million loan to town square and was supposed to provide permanent financing for the project bank of nova scotia began foreclosure proceedings last summer in las vegas against the turnberry affiliate that owns town square but the bank claims discussions have now broken down according to court documents discussions on loan restructuring with the soffers dated back to march when the construction loan went into default turnberry paints a different picture saying talks about a voluntary foreclosure are ongoing and that it hopes to maintain an ownership stake in the property at the southern end of the las vegas strip we re still in the negotiating process jackie soffer said we re still overseeing the property we re looking to have a positive outcome this week the fight rolled over into the lehman brothers bankruptcy court case as bank of nova scotia argued that lehman brothers is not a party to the town square mortgage the bank wants a judge to find that lehman has no property interest in the mall this filing is not a surprise mike wethington general manager of town square las vegas said in a statement the bank of nova scotia filed this action in the lehman brothers bankruptcy case simply to protect its interest in the mall the town square project is the second soffer project in las vegas to suffer as part of the

prominent miami developers craig robins and ugo colombo are slated to head back to court friday in their six year old legal fight over a private jet an attorney for robins wants last month s million

colombo agreed to buy half of a million bombardier challenger but failed to follow through on the agreement lawsuit describes art blacklist to keep some collectors away imagine a market for highly sought after items in which the makers and sellers work hard to ensure that the items go only to certain buyers even if other buyers might be willing to pay more the favored buyers are then expected not to resell the items for many years even if the values skyrocket ideally in fact the buyers are expected to give these items away eventually for the public good and if the buyers don t abide by these expectations they risk being cut off cast out with the other unwashed wealthy who can afford to buy but have no access at least according to craig robins a prominent miami art collector and real estate developer who filed a federal lawsuit on march in manhattan this is a portrait of the workings of the primary market for contemporary art which despite the recession remains immense and highly competitive at its heart the million suit is a fairly ordinary contract dispute about confidentiality agreements and sales promises but the details of the disagreement have provided a rare view into a normally very private world of high end art selling in which membership rules responsibilities rewards and reprisals can be so complex and changeable that even art world veterans say they sometimes struggle to decode them mr robins asserts that he sold a painting of a dark figure by the highly praised south african born artist marlene dumas through the david zwirner gallery in chelsea in with an agreement that the sale remain confidential but the gallery which did not yet represent ms dumas told her about it mr robins claims causing her to become angry with him because like many artists she prefers to see her paintings remain long term in prominent collections mr robins says that ms dumas one of whose paintings sold for more than million at sotheby s in maintains an active blacklist of those she views as speculating in her work a blacklist that he says he is now on and whose existence his lawyers who were back in court on the case this week say they plan to prove the suit which claims million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from the gallery also claims that mr zwirner promised to help get mr robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from against the wall the current show of ms dumas s work at zwirner which is now her gallery but that this did not happen in its legal response the gallery has called the suit baseless saying it had never promised choice works or confidentiality after the sale by bringing suit the gallery s lawyers argue the wealthy robins has literally made a federal case of not being able to buy what he wants when he wants as for the supposed blacklist the lawyers added as if addressing a purely philosophical problem if such a list exists and if robins is on it zwirner did not put him there and cannot take him off but several dealers art advisers and collectors specializing in contemporary art said in recent interviews that with the explosion of the art market over the last several years and a sharp rise in the number of speculative buyers entering the market those who sell art have become much more wary of collectors motives and that they keep in addition to secret waiting lists for in demand artists another even more secret list of buyers suspected of wanting to flip art for a quick profit even serious collectors who are generally regarded more as keepers than as sellers complain that in recent years several dealers and highly involved artists like ms dumas have gone overboard in their protectiveness and desire to control an artwork s destiny after it is sold i think sometimes there s a fair amount of hypocrisy from some of these dealers said adam lindemann a longtime collector and author of a book collecting contemporary that offers advice to aspiring collectors i m not buying a can of sardines here mr lindemann said i m buying something that i m in love with but times change and sometimes you need to sell things mr robins s suit and a similar one filed in against a new york dealer by a prominent european collector jean pierre lehmann who also complained of an inability to buy choice works are seen as evidence by some within the collecting world that the contemporary art market has become so contentious that even serious long term collectors are now being pushed into fights mr robins for example owns works by ms dumas and has called her one of the top three artists in my collection mr zwirner and ms dumas declined to comment about the lawsuit mr robins s lawyer aaron richard golub also declined to comment except to offer a general observation about dealers they might say they re motivated by trying to place pieces in museums and the right collections and such but at the end of the day it s all about profit nexis the new york times high flying partners dispute jet

larry kudlow carl icahn the majority of wall street ceos and rank and file bankers and traders and their lobbyists view trump as lousy to do business with because they say he s cheap on fees an likely to sue and a massive risk on both foreign and domestic policy wall street types generally don t like risk and while trump has said he wants to junk dodd frank he has also promised some kind of alternative the idea that the populist trump is going to propose something that bankers would like is well it s not likely plus wall street has mostly learned to live with dodd frank after spending six years implementing its restrictions and higher capital requirements starting over with an entirely new financial reform law is not what anybody in the industry wants sure bankers worry that hillary clinton is lurching left in the age of bernie but plenty of them will either sit out or actively work to defeat trump bloomberg s kevin cirilli the banking industry is flummoxed on what to do

contributors which is about half the pac had become the talk of political circles both in and outside of miami beach for its rapid fundraising from entities who have business with the city and its activity attracted the attention of the miami dade commission on ethics and public trust which started an investigation the committee sparked a debate about the role of soft money in local politics particularly in a city like miami beach which has an ordinance that prohibits vendors developers and lobbyists from donating directly or indirectly to candidates campaigns wolfson had planned on using relentless for progress whose initials mirror the acronym for the way cities solicit city vendors request for proposal to back candidates in this year s beach elections three commission seats are up for grabs in november and mayor philip levine has a challenger the beach s city attorney had opined that contributions to rfp were legal as long as they were not earmarked for specific candidates by the donors all along wolfson and levine who helped solicit contributors defended themselves and the committee in the miami herald and on television but fellow commissioner ed tobin criticized the committee from the dais and local political journalist michael putney slammed rfp on more than one occasion in a herald op ed and during this week in south florida during at least one of those broadcasts a slick tv commercial starring levine and paid for by the pac aired between segments the ad which levine insists was not a campaign commercial but featured him listing the chief initiatives during his term as mayor ran at least three times it has since gotten placement before youtube videos wolfson also bought a full page ad in the herald taking aim at putney the ad ran three times now wolfson is saying he will close rfp and give contributors their money back after some heated debate as well as much personal reflection i have made the decision to close the pac he said wednesday in an emailed statement the pac was legal ethical and appropriate fundraising from stakeholders is a practice that has been going on throughout the country in local state and federal elections for years our nation s highest court has ruled that it is protected free speech in an interview on thursday afternoon wolfson told the miami herald that he reflected on the contentious debate surrounding his committee after former miami beach mayor david dermer whom wolfson considers a mentor visited him at home to discuss rfp he gave me good guidance and direction on the topic he said when he came to me and mentioned it it made me take a step back and reflect through the end of july rfp brought in about million and spent about on mailers tv spots campaign contributions to four county judges and political consulting the committee s financial activity from august is not yet available wolfson said he would refund all of the remaining money in the committee s account on a pro rata basis meaning each donor would get an amount back in proportion to what was donated he said he plans to bring a new ordinance to the beach s commission that will prohibit elected officials and candidates or their designees from soliciting any contributions from vendors lobbyists and real estate developers with any interest in miami beach projects we should hold ourselves to a higher standard he said during the last two months of my service i will continue to lead miami beach in the right direction with dignity and integrity wolfson is term limited this year on thursday he said he does not know what is next for him after public office though he wants to remain active in beach issues a vocal opponent of the proposed land lease for a headquarter hotel next to the miami beach convention center he said he d likely publicly speak out against it on his own dime levine had gone on putney s sunday morning program to defend himself and the pac in july on thursday the mayor said he applauded wolfson s decision i think the pac became a distraction to the real issues that we need to be discussing in moving our city forward he said upon learning of the pac s closing on thursday tobin was skeptical that

continues to refuse to release his tax returns while claiming quite laughably that there is nothing to learn from them and trump continues to say he is completely flexible on the promises he made to gop voters in the primaries rnc chair reince priebus confronted with all this on abc s this week basically punted and said that in i don t think the traditional playbook applies to his credit priebus said trump would have to answer for his treatment of women but for the rest of it priebus suggested none if it will matter and voters will back trump as they did in the primaries because he will blow up the system in washington perhaps they will but the early numbers don t look good a poll out on sunday showed a dead heat in georgia a state democrats haven t won since bill clinton in if hillary clinton can win in the south her already sizeable electoral college advantage could turn into a giant rout the counter argument is that trump could win florida and ohio and challenge clinton across the rust belt possibly but to do that trump would have to overcome huge losses in south florida and urban areas in the midwest trump s electoral map at this early stage looks daunting if not

conversation with apta chair valarie mccall and acting president and ceo richard a white the duo declined to comment on the specifics of the resignation reports of leadership in fighting as well as allegations that the organization was spending exorbitantly in the time preceding the shakeup we are moving forward what we don t want to do is to get into the weeds of what people may be saying mccall insisted read non disclosure agreement but they did give some indication of the steps the organization will take in coming months to get back in the good graces of members and amid talk of focusing on the future and one of those things that will make us stronger as an organization they also hinted that they recognize spots where the longtime institution may have gone wrong on the plan going forward they ve got several task forces aimed at looking at issues such as the organization s governance and finances and most of all they said they re listening to members concerns reform will be high on the list of discussion items at two major apta meetings planned for the coming weeks i think the main thing we re focused on right now is listening to our members listening to our stakeholders and reinforcing our value mccall said it s about looking at where we can focus our strengths to be better aligned with our members on that stinging mta letter white said the organization was already aware of many of the issues outlined before the letter was sent and the response to those concerns he said have been in motion for a while white also intimated that they re hoping mta reconsiders its exit after apta rethinks the structure of its membership dues funding model and spending priorities and mta officials look at those options on finances one task force will be focused specifically on how the organization is collecting and spending money the mta s letter complained that the number of meetings resulted in the public perception of these conferences as wasteful boondoggles before quitting the mta paid apta per year it s all on the table to be evaluated both the dues and the registration costs white said we want to make sure we don t have a tin ear on the kinds of things that members are saying that we need to address on the governance structure one of the mta s big knocks on apta was the notion that the organization s board and executive committee failed to adequately represent legacy transit systems and also lacked the geographic diversity of the organization s members white acknowledged that criticism we got a little out of balance over the last few years and we didn t so intentionally white said but the unintended consequence was that an imbalance got created and it needs to be dealt with soon and it s going to be dealt with soon next

needed to finally claim the republican presidential nomination as his own the prospect of a historic contested convention has surrounded trump s candidacy for months but trump is much closer to winning the nomination outright following his resounding victories in tuesday s east coast primaries which boosted his delegate count to at least compared to for his chief rival ted cruz trump needs

day","illinoisplaybook@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," am edtby natasha korecki nkorecki politico com natashakorecki with manuela tobias mtobias politico com manuelatobiasm good wednesday morning illinois the wheels in springfield are churning with the so called budgeteer group meeting in private on tuesday evening and reportedly making progress in talks the governor s office too has been meeting with the group and according to a rauner administration official there s real movement from the beginning of the process our office has been forward leaning in the interest of getting a deal the official told illinois playbook the budget group is a place where only bipartisan bicameral agreement can come forward folks with an agenda might want to advantage themselves by putting revenue ideas on one party but the group will only produce something that everyone can agree to no huge surprises on the table here the governor s office is willing to talk about revenue options but they must be paired with reforms that s something gov bruce rauner has long discussed and the republican first term governor has backed off significantly from what reforms must be part of a budget package the x factor as always is democratic house speaker mike madigan madigan has repeatedly said he s wanted a mix of cuts and new revenue and has rejected pairing rauner s turnaround agenda with a budget but we are far away from the kinds of demands rauner was making a year ago we are also much farther in the hole on a bill backlog pension debt and we have a litany of social service groups screaming for help what s promising about the budgeteer group is that it includes some of the best budget minds in the state and was handpicked by the four legislative leaders and the governor s office so everyone has skin in the game we re told those who met on tuesday were taking a day to digest productive conversations welcome to the politico illinois playbook have a tip event announcement endorsement send to

districts what s its fate now manar talked to reporters in the statehouse on tuesday q have you talked to people in the house do you think you have support over there manar we ll find out on republicans manar said the idea here is to stifle progress and to promote the status quo which for some reason the governor on one hand admits is broken but on another reason takes great steps and goes and to great lengths to protect it so here s another example where we have a complete lack of clarity on the part of governor rauner on the most critical issue that faces the state today so i m disappointed by much of the debate where just flat out false numbers were used and were stated during the course of what ought to be an above board debate in the senate senate passes reform school funding reform measure passes senate fate in house uncertain by state journal register s doug finke a school funding reform bill intended to direct more money to the state s neediest school districts narrowly won approval in the illinois senate tuesday the senate voted with three members voting present to send the bill to the house where it faces an uncertain future house speaker michael madigan d chicago has formed a house task force to conduct its own review of school funding this year madigan also did not formally assign house members to a special task force two years ago whose work ultimately led to the bill that was approvedvote of confidence quit pouring money into unfair system decatur herald amp review s editorial board while many illinois school districts would welcome additional money from the state there s a question whether it s wise to continue to throw more money into a system that is seriously flawed that appears to be what gov bruce rauner and republicans in the general assembly want to do sen andy manar d bunker hill has been leading the charge for years to change the way public schools are funded in illinois the current system is grossly unfair with rich districts spending up to per student and poorer districts getting by on as little as per student the result ispainful reversal city school districts to return cash after state funding error by pioneer press lee v gaines evanston s two school districts will need to forfeit roughly a quarter million dollars each back to the state due to a calculation error announced last month by the illinois department of revenue the errors are part of a misallocation of million worth of tax revenue dispersed by the state to local governments since about taxing districts throughout illinois were affected

s connor o brien and austin wright stuttgart germany a u s service member has been killed in northern iraq defense secretary ash carter said tuesday in a statement the u s led coalition against the islamic state of iraq and the levant said the death was the result of enemy fire carter made the announcement at the outset of a press conference here with joint chiefs chairman gen joe dunford and newly installed european command chief gen curtis scaparrotti carter thornberry clash on defense spending the defense secretary is continuing his criticism of the republican plan to boost defense spending by short changing the last five months of the war budget escalating his fight with house armed services republicans who put the plan in motion our colleague connor who is traveling with the defense secretary has more from stuttgart the proposal is to take money out of the wartime funding account in wartime carter told reporters monday that s objectionable on the face of it the defense secretary was responding to a question on his reaction to comments last week from republican rep mike turner of ohio who charged carter had lost total credibility by submitting a budget that did not include more war funds to fill an anticipated shortfall in the pentagon s base budget the house national defense authorization act for the new fiscal year approved last week by the house armed services committee allocates billion in war related overseas contingency operations funds to support the pentagon s base budget but carter knocks the bill for authorizing things that are not our highest priorities and that we didn t ask for republicans are the ones going back on the pact he countered by pushing for a higher levels than agreed to one of the reasons i object to what s going on is that it undermines precisely that bipartisan stability carter said the defense secretary declined to say however whether he d recommend the president veto the ndaa over the war funding issue thornberry responds gutting readiness is what s objectionable carter s comments monday sparked a response from house armed services chairman mac thornberry r texas who said he was determined to turn our readiness crisis around even if i have to do it over the secretary s objections what s objectionable is deploying troops who aren t fully trained whose equipment is worn out and who didn t get the resources they needed back home to be ready to face our enemies overseas thornberry said in a statement responding to carter what s objectionable is cutting the military well below levels anyone thinks is wise denying our troops their pay raise for three years in a row forcing them to live in crumbling barracks o newsr work in hangars that have literally been condemned happening today carter attends u s european change of command carter attended the change of command for the u s european command in stuttgart the changeover from air force gen philip breedlove to scaparrotti was followed by a joint news conference with carter scaparrotti and joint chiefs chairman gen joe dunford on the plane en route to germany carter praised both breedlove and scaparrotti whom he called innovators carter called the retiring breedlove the spearhead on many key nato issues and said he helped lead the way on the international response to russia s invasion of crimea carter also said promoting scaparrotti who most recently commanded u s forces on the korean peninsula to nato supreme allied commander was an easy recommendation for him to make expect talk on europe s challenges this will be more than just a change of command ceremony address one senior defense official said in advance of carter s visit pentagon officials have noted threats to europe including renewed russian aggression and the islamic state have changed the command s responsibilities significantly carter is also expected to tout recent military investments in the region particulary the proposed quadrupling of the

that iraq s political tumult had trended in a more stabilizing direction but the vice president s plane had barely left iraqi airspace when the country s political divisions exploded with hundreds of protesters storming into baghdad s green zone occupying the fortified area for much of the weekend to demand an end to government corruption the developments threaten to distract from the fight against the islamic state which has grabbed vast swaths of iraqi territory at the same time the situation underscores the limited influence u s officials even one as deeply versed in iraq as biden have over the politics of the country america invaded years ago obama administration officials on monday defended the optimistic overtures from biden and his aides they say the onus for resolving the political standoff between iraqi prime minister haider al abadi and his opponents should rest on the shoulders of iraqis because any overt u s role could lead to a backlash obama reflects on terrorism

will try not to get whiplash moving between the house and senate this week as defense bills are marked up in both chambers in the house the defense appropriations subcommittee is marking up its defense spending bill in closed session an earlier date than prior years while the senate armed services committee is marking up its national defense authorization act all week and mostly behind closed doors here s a rundown of what to watch for what will be different for ndaa in the senate our preview with connor o brien in what could be his final year wielding the gavel he long coveted senate armed services committee chairman john mccain is poised to pursue another round of far reaching reforms in the annual defense policy bill setting up major conflicts with the house version awaiting floor action with mccain facing a competitive reelection fight back home in arizona and control of the senate up for grabs the legislation will surely bear the distinct mark of the republican senator pushing back against the administration s defense budget topline taking a hardline on the effort to replace the russian rd rocket engine and pursuing aggressive reforms of the military s command structure and health system mccain s eagerness to enact sweeping reforms is a contrast to the incremental approach pushed by his house counterpart rep mac thornberry r texas and the differing approaches and priorities are likely to give the chairmen a slew of issues to hammer out in the end during a house senate conference committee a full breakdown of the biggest differences is here for pros the sasc schedule markups get underway this afternoon with the airland subcommittee considering up its portion of the bill in closed session the rest of the subcommittees are on tuesday with

his trip to germany last week after a navy seal died in iraq last week in an islamic state attack defense secretary ash carter was quick to hail him as a warrior who died in combat an ocean away white house press secretary josh earnest offered a different take while characterizing carter s remarks as accurate earnest said special warfare officer st class charles keating iv was not in a combat mission but he was in a dangerous place the twin reactions to the latest u s casualty in the middle east demonstrated once again that president barack obama and his more hawkish defense secretary aren t completely in sync on the fight against the islamic state of iraq and the levant a war the white house is trying to downplay if not constrain carter s worldview puts him more in line with democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton than with obama and several analysts said carter could be in the running to remain in his post should clinton win in november at least for a time others shot down the prospect as unlikely by all accounts though carter is now in his dream job the pinnacle of a career at the pentagon that began in the early s when he was a physicist working on nuclear weapons issues and his status as obama s fourth pentagon chief the white house almost certainly wants to avoid having a fifth gives him some room to stake out positions that might be more in line with

"2016-04-26 00:59","FW: WaPo: Obama, who once stood as party outsider, now works to strengthen Democrats","GarciaW@dnc.org","KaplanJ@dnc.org"," flagging this article for you guys â particularly because it mentions that potus has been doing more frs for us have a good night recently in dallas before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of dollars to the democratic senatorial campaign committee obama diagnosed one of the problems â democrats just arenâ t very good at focusing on down ballot races â he said according to two participants the president may have been stating the obvious but it reflected a shift in thinking among democrats who are working furiously to shore up state level candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting since obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the dnc and both congressional committees doing more than events for the dnc alone barack obama rose to prominence as a different kind of democrat an outsider who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate course eight years later the president finds himself working hard to restore a party from which he was once eager to stand apart obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party than any two term president since world war ii and represents one last opportunity for him to reverse that trend but it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with establishing his own political base outside the democratic national committee and has downsized the scale of political operations inside the white house the first big tests of the rebuilding efforts come tuesday in pennsylvania where obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested democratic primaries endorsing senate hopeful katie mcginty and josh shapiro a montgomery county official and early supporter of his who is hoping to become state attorney general should democrats claim those two offices in the fall it would represent a small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party below the presidential level under obamaâ s watch between and democrats lost senate seats house seats state legislative seats governorships and state legislative chambers according to data compiled by university of virginia professor larry j sabato the only president in the past years who comes close is dwight d eisenhower who saw a similar decline for the gop during his time in office â the republican party is arguably stronger now than theyâ ve ever been in years despite not having the white house â said simon rosenberg a longtime democratic operative and president of ndn a liberal think tank democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition obama galvanized in and then reassembled in will turn out when he is no longer on the ballot the current democratic presidential primary contest has so far fractured that coalition with young people flocking to sen bernie sanders of vermont while many voters of color â especially older ones â back former secretary of state hillary clinton many factors have contributed to republicansâ gains on the state and federal levels including a concerted push by their donors to target state races and a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congressional district lines obamaâ s defenders contend that after major victories in and it was predictable that democrats would lose significant ground in the midterm elections of and but they add the presidentâ s two successful white house bids have vastly upgraded the partyâ s voter outreach infrastructure by expanding the national voter file the democratic national committee first started in and they point to the huge increases in the number of democratic campaign volunteers â from roughly in to million in â as evidence of that upgrade â barack obama has single handedly modernized the democratsâ ability to wage campaigns on the local level â said jim messina who managed obamaâ s reâ election campaign rosenberg agrees saying that the president built on the work of bill clinton the only other two term democratic president of the last generation â clinton established the intellectual framework for the democratic party and obama modernized its politics â rosenberg said â what isnâ t there yet is a large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it on â some of obamaâ s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for democrats organizing for action ofa the nonprofit group that grew out of obamaâ s campaign operation has continued to compete with the democratic national committee for democratic dollars â first as a parallel organization within the dnc and then as a separate entity in the first six months of the dnc raised million while ofa raised million and this was at a time when the dnc was carrying more than million in debt those fiscal constraints meant the dnc had to curtail the money it provided to state parties a practice that dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz d fla reversed in by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each state from a month to close cooperation has taken time ofa gave the dnc limited access to its list of supporters starting in but it turned over the entire list only in august now according to nevada democratic party chair roberta lange â that voter file is used by everyone in our state â while many ofa volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local political battles the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts for diverting resources during a gathering of democratic governors in washington according to multiple attendees one governor asked a senior presidential political adviser â will the ofa please join the democratic party â but this white house unlike that of bill clinton has always kept its political operation on a separate track under clinton the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people â in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs â and the president got a political briefing once a week by contrast obama limited election activity in the white house a reflection of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of white house chief of staff denis mcdonough who has little campaign experience outside of working on obamaâ s first presidential bid obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the operation to his chicago campaign headquarters he appointed david simas who directs the white house office of political strategy and outreach to his current position only in january after congressional democrats complained they did not have a direct white house contact for political matters obamaâ s senior political advisers from his first term â messina david plouffe and david axelrod among others â have left to focus on ventures in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day to day democratic politics plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on but acknowledged that obamaâ s relationship with his top political operatives didnâ t automatically translate to other candidates â you donâ t do your best work being a mercenary â said plouffe now a strategic adviser to the car service firm uber he added that it will take the commitment of wealthy democratic donors â not just top party officials â to target state contests the way republicans have â i think we all agree something has to be done â he said â the question is how itâ s not going to be the dnc â obama for his part has set limits for what he will do in connection with super pacs while in office while he did fundraising events for the one that backed his reelection campaign priorities usa mcdonough and obamaâ s lawyers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the senate majority pac a similar entity supporting senate democrats in an april memo to then senate majority leader harry m reid d nev the pacâ s counsel marc e elias stipulated that to avoid any conflict of interest obama would not actually ask potential senate majority pac donors for money even when appearing at one of the groupâ s events after making this point on the memoâ s first page he reiterated two pages later with underlined emphasis â again to be clear the president will not solicit contributions at or in connection with any of these meetings â after a protracted and bitter exchange reidâ s aides abandoned their effort to involve obama in any more than a few super pac events and the president agreed to transfer million from the dnc to both the democratic senatorial campaign committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee in the fall of during the cycle the dnc made no transfers to the two committees but with his popularity high among democrats and no election ahead of him obama has been working to shore up his party both financially and politically and his aides say obama has turned controversial issues including immigration gay rights and climate change to the democratsâ advantage â he will be aggressive from the presidential level down to the state and local representative level â simas said â thereâ s going to be a democratic nominee and democratic candidates they are the ones who are going to be driving the campaigns and the president will be there to be as helpful as possible â recently in dallas before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of dollars to the democratic senatorial campaign committee obama diagnosed one of the problems â democrats just arenâ t very good at focusing on down ballot races â he said according to two participants the president may have been stating the obvious but it reflected a shift in thinking among democrats who are working furiously to shore up state level candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting since obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the dnc and both congressional committees doing more than events for the dnc alone sen charles e schumer n y the second ranking democrat in the senate said that when he asked obama to make a series of primary endorsements this cycle including one of mcginty â he just did it with no muss no fuss in a very great way â in december the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint redistricting strategy and obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal for the democratic governors association in january even former members such as rep barney frank d mass have been asked to attend fundraisers on behalf of state lawmakers in states such as ohio â we have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making those investments â said rep steve israel d n y adding that while house democrats will have â a very strong wind at their backsâ this year â the day after this election we have to understand that the windâ s going to be in our faces â in many democrats in conservative states were eager to tap obamaâ s fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side by side with a president with sagging popularity ratings already is different longtime democratic strategist donna brazile said that for a long time democrats wanted obamaâ s resources â including money and analytics â â but they didnâ t want his presence â when she called the white house last year to ask if the president would do robo calls to african american voters during louisianaâ s special election for governor white house officials seemed surprised that democrat john bel edwards even wanted their help brazile assured them that he did and democrats increasingly believe that they will need obama in the fall to regain some of the ground theyâ ve lost since â part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench â brazile said democratic congressional campaign committee chairman ben ray lujã n n m said in an interview that the president will help in unifying the democratic base â heâ s going to help boost turnout in november which is critical when youâ re winning races on the margins â lujã n said "
