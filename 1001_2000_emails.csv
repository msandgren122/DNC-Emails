parks sued the city in order to preserve a parking lot we were offered a different and feasible solution the replacement of an underutilized and outdated convention space that would also add more than acres of new parkland no friend to chicago this is a city of big shoulders and a metropolis that is second to none in refusing to accept the extraordinary public benefits of the museum the friends of

that is no victory for anyone some people not so torn up so long george don t let the door hit you on way out by chicago sun times neil steinberg if the mayor actually cared about the whole city as he pretends to he d be leaning on lucas to put his new museum in pullman and not using the lakefront downtown to draw people to it instead of using the museum to draw people elsewhere maybe because it

"2016-05-10 23:28","DNC Talking Points - West Virginia, Nebraska Primaries","PaustenbachM@dnc.org","PaustenbachM@dnc.org"," west virginia nebraska primary talking pointstopline message with his lock on the republican nomination donald trump has ensured that his party s problems won t be limited to convention chaos he s going to force gop races big and small across the country to have to own his ugly divisive and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election that s why the party faithful from senior leaders to the voters of nebraska and west virginia today have started to fret publicly about their party s deepening divides and stumble with no real strategy for embracing their divisive and dangerous standard bearer democrats on the other hand have shown in state after state that our voters are excited about our primary and optimistic about both of our candidates but we re not taking anything for granted we re going to hold trump and republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their repeated promises to drag our country right back to the reckless policies that were in place in when the last republican president left office when we were losing jobs a month and when countless americans lost their homes and savings the american people can t afford to let a republican into the white house key points today ted cruz refused to throw his support behind trump adding his name to the growing list of gop leaders distancing themselves from the party s nominee a list that includes former presidential candidates mitt romney and john mccain and the entire bush family who all said they won t attend their own convention this year and as we look toward trump s upcoming meeting with republican senate leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan this thursday at the rnc it s clear that any signs they ll show of camaraderie on the way out will be purely cosmetic that division isn t just happening at the top it s visible all the way down to the grassroots of the republican party in exit polls today just ten percent of republican voters in west virginia and three percent in nebraska said they think their party is united while republican candidates across the country up and down the ballot are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing beside trump the dangerous and reckless candidate they created or avoiding their own convention to distance themselves democrats are poised to ride enthusiasm and support for our candidates into november in contest after contest democratic voters are reporting their enthusiasm for both of our candidates while republicans report that their primary has divided their party the national trend favors democrats who have seen in exit polls week after week that our voters are excited about our primary o in indiana last week three quarters of democrats said they ve been energized by the nomination contest while nearly six in ten republicans said they think their party has been divided o in pennsylvania the week before the story was the same as it was in new york the week before that and wisconsin before that democrats are building the infrastructure for the general election and we re doing it with voters enthusiastic because they see our candidates have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years we ve seen a record straight months of private sector job growth creating over million new jobs and million people have health care who didn t before we must elect a democrat as our next president to keep america on the right track and moving forward divisive reckless and dangerous donald trump lacks the judgment or temperament to be presidentdonald trump s recklessness would hurt our economy diminish our standing in the world and make our communities less safe trump is divisive and dangerous and he lacks the judgment and temperament to be president trump s impending nomination is a reminder that for years the republican party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain just like republicans in washington have done for years trump is only looking out for himself his plans would benefit those at the very top and economists have predicted that his policies could cause a global recession he would drag our country back to where we were when the last republican president left office when we were losing jobs a month the american people can t afford to let trump bully his way into the oval office trump has already damaged america s relationships across the globe his record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe and his business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the american people can t afford to let him get anywhere near the white house national security even as a candidate donald trump has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would undeniably make america less safe donald trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well respected experts trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words on his good brain trump has falsely claimed that he knows more about isis than the generals and recommended that the u s military commit international war crimes trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on european territory and wants to allow countries that don t currently have nuclear weapons to get them reversing long held goals of international nuclear disarmament wrong on women donald trump has a decades long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny his policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their health care or their career trump once said you had to treat women like s t and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names fat pig slob or bimbo and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be griping and bitching trump would take away a woman s right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished but not the doctors that performed them and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to the marketplace and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was an inconvenience for a business trump complained that when he employed mothers they were not giving him percent divisive and dangerous donald trump exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the pursuit of getting elected to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about muslims and called to surveil mosques to ban muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all muslims in america including u s citizens and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from nazi germany trump called mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and said they brought disease into the country said you needed to check if native americans were real indians and claimed that a well educated black has a tremendous advantage but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in trump properties because in the s the trump organization was sued for discriminating against blacks and puerto ricans trump has been endorsed by former kkk leader david duke and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement which is no surprise since trump refused to disavow david duke and the kkk four times in one interview trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies suggesting that a black lives matter protester maybe should have been roughed up promising to pay the legal fees if someone would knock the hell out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be carried off on a stretcher trump repeatedly threatened the first amendment by calling to open up libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies and thought closing parts of the internet was a rational strategy to combat isis reckless on the economy making millions at the expense of hardworking americans though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman donald trump s real life record is a reminder that he would endanger the entire global financial system and promote policies that hurt everyday americans despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of american jobs donald trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against like china and mexico a reminder that he made millions at the expense of american workers and on the backs of foreign labor his trump university fleeced thousands of americans simply looking to get ahead trump s businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt leaving investors contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his bad business decisions trump s tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while costing the country trillion to implement more than any other republican plan proposed it also violates his pledge to eliminate the national debt trump actually said at one of the republican party s debates that wages were too high and opposed raising the federal minimum wage trump wants to repeal the affordable care act which would jeopardize health care for million americans who ve been able to get coverage under obamacare how democrats will winrepublicans couldn t unite against trump and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party democrats will be united and hold donald trump accountable every day until november th both hillary clinton and bernie sanders have been clear they ll work hard in november to ensure we don t let a republican like trump drag our country backward while we recognize that any campaign will see the intensity level rise down the stretch we expect our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election hillary clinton and bernie sanders have drawn sharp differences with one another but overwhelmingly they ve been focused on substance and how to best move america forward because the party s platform is a statement of our values the dnc is committed to an open inclusive and representative process both of our campaigns will be represented on the platform drafting committee and just as we did in and the public will have opportunities to participate democrats know that we re stronger when more voices are heard and when we stand together to move our country forward we ll see that in philadelphia at

company is bearing checks alex sink learned this the hard way when an invitation for her monday fundraiser in miami beach listed two donors with checkered pasts the leading democratic contender for governor a buttoned down former banker decided to dump both donors for fear they would be used to smear her the first casualty was former miami city commissioner johnny winton who was booted from office in after a drunken and profane run in with police sink removed him as a co host of the fundraiser on wednesday some strategists saw that as a no brainer for a campaign that made a rookie mistake by failing to background big donors others said sink would have created less fuss had she stood by winton and wasn t she was boxing herself in so every donor with a less than perfect profile would be questioned on friday they did turns out that one of the event s co chairs george lindemann wealthy chairman of the bass art musem s board of trustees served time for ordering a hit on his show horse and collecting in insurance money he was sentenced in to months in prison we make decisions on a case by case basis and lindemann was convicted of insurance fraud said sink spokeswoman tara klimek this particular circumstance is over the line sink s rejection of winton and lindemann raises questions about where candidates should draw the line when vetting donors is a pending investigation cause for concern or only a conviction is slugging a cop as bad as arranging the killing of a horse and what s the statute of limitations on these matters another co chair of the sink reception publicist seth gordon was removed as a volunteer campaign advisor to miami dade state attorney katherine fernandez rundlein after police told her he was a suspect in the death of his first wife gordon has denied murdering her and never been charged gordon who recruited lindemann to help sink defended his friend and noted his involvement in civic causes george doesn t deserve to continue to be a punching bag he has contributed to every democratic presidential candidate and no one has ever suggested that they didn t want his money gordon said indeed lindemann has donated generously to a slew of candidates including u s rep kendrick meek u s sen bill nelson and former presidential contender hillary clinton so it s okay to cash his checks but not to give him top billing on a fundraising invite even florida s master politician gov charlie crist has struggled with this issue at first he stood by a top fundraiser in developer sergio pino whose relationship with a county

spokeswoman said five days later pino stepped down crist said of his decision i think it was the right thing to do the miami herald the rielle deal how local scandal begets national scandal in the charged world of fort lauderdale politics and businessrielle hunter who was born in fort lauderdale years ago has had an alarmingly eventful life as a teenager she was an accomplished equestrienne who rode a champion jumping horse until the animal was electrocuted in its stable by a hit man from chicago part of one of the biggest scandals to ever hit florida s blueblood horse set as a blond and pretty young woman her voracious appetite for cocaine and men caught the attention of novelist jay mcinerney who based a lead character on her in a bestselling book about the excesses of the s now in middle age she s become a notorious national media celebrity as the femme fatale in the scandal that has all but destroyed the political career of former democratic presidential candidate john edwards it s been a wild wandering and wanton life for hunter who spent her childhood in tamarac as lisa jo druck her given name and to understand hunter she married divorced and kept her ex husband s name it s instructive to look back at those years in fort lauderdale specifically at the untold story of her father james druck who was a powerful attorney in downtown fort lauderdale for nearly two decades once the family was transplanted to ocala things only got worse in a particularly nasty turn of events druck hired an assassin named tommy the sandman burns to kill his daughter s horse henry the hawk for the insurance money the event deeply traumatized his daughter who was near the stable when the horse was electrocuted burns later admitted to federal investigators that he had killed about horses one of those sentenced to prison in the case was george lindemann jr a palm beach scion to a billion dollar fortune like druck he also had burns kill a show horse for the insurance money hunter who was with a boyfriend when burns killed the animal saw the horse dead on the stable floor mcinerney fictionalized the account in his book the story of my life the character based on hunter named allison poole recounts that she was so distraught by the killing of the horse named dangerous dan in the book that she had to be kept on tranquilizers for a week the book was published before the edwards scandal broke and the poole character would also be included in american psycho a bestselling novel by bret easton ellis james druck died in of lung cancer before he could be brought to justice on the insurance fraud charge the rest of the story quite literally is history new times broward palm beach convict contributions sen charles schumer d n y has accepted thousands of dollars in

trump lacks the judgment or temperament to be presidentdonald trump s recklessness would hurt our economy diminish our standing in the world and make our communities less safe trump is dangerous and he lacks the judgment or temperament to be president his impending nomination is a reminder that for years the republican party has elevated extreme voices using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain and just like republicans in washington have done for years dangerous donald is only looking out for himself his plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country back to where we were when the last republican president left office losing jobs a month the american people can t afford to let him bully his way into the oval office dangerous donald trump has already damaged america s relationships across the globe his record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe and his business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the american people can t afford to let him get anywhere near the white house national security even as a candidate dangerous donald has damaged america s relationships across the globe in the white house he would undeniably make america less safe donald trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well respected experts trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words on his good brain trump has falsely claimed that he knows more about isis than the generals and recommended that the u s military commit international war crimes trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on european territory and wants to allow countries that don t currently have nuclear weapons to get them reversing long held goals of international nuclear disarmament wrong on women dangerous donald has a decades long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny his policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career trump once said you had to treat women like s t and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names fat pig slob or bimbo and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be griping and bitching trump would take away a woman s right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished but not the doctors that performed them and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to the marketplace and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was an inconvenience for a business trump complained that when he employed mothers they were not giving him percent divisive and dangerous dangerous donald exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the pursuit of getting elected to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color protestors and the media trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about muslims and called to surveil mosques to ban muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all muslims in america including u s citizens and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from nazi germany trump called mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and said they brought disease into the country said you needed to check if native americans were real indians and claimed that a well educated black has a tremendous advantage but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in trump properties because in the s the trump organization was sued for discriminating against blacks and puerto ricans trump has been endorsed by former kkk leader david duke and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement which is no surprise since trump refused to disavow david duke and the kkk four times in one interview trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies suggesting that a black lives matter protester maybe should have been roughed up promising to pay the legal fees if someone would knock the hell out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be carried off on a stretcher trump repeatedly threatened the first amendment by calling to open up libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies and thought closing parts of the internet was a rational strategy to combat isis bad at business bad for the economy though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman dangerous donald s real life record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday americans despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of american jobs donald trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against like china and mexico dangerous donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family dangerous donald s businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt leaving investors contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions during one of his business bankruptcies his personal finances were at the mercy of banks who put him on an allowance of per month his trump university fleeced thousands of americans simply looking to get ahead trump s tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while costing the country trillion to implement more than any other republican plan proposed it also violates his pledge not to increase the national debt trump actually said at one of the republican party s debates that wages are too high and opposed raising the minimum wage trump wants to repeal the affordable care act which would jeopardize health care for million americans who ve been able to get coverage under obamacare republicans couldn t unite against him and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party democrats will be united and hold

a new survey of american military personnel donald trump emerged as active duty service members preference to become the next u s president topping hillary clinton by more than a to margin however in the latest military times election survey more than one in five troops said they d rather not vote in november if they have to choose between just those two candidates but given only those choices percent of the service members surveyed said they would abstain from voting more than percent of the troops military times surveyed said they would vote for trump the presumed republican presidential nominee over clinton the democratic front runner only about percent said they would vote for clinton in that matchup the results while not a scientific sampling of military voting patterns show strong support for trump among troops despite critics attacks that he lacks foreign policy or national security experience but but but the caveats the sample is not a perfect representation of the military as a whole it over represents officers and noncommissioned officers and under represents junior enlisted personnel however it is representative of the more senior and career oriented members of the

come true along with outcomes even the skeptics did not predict ula has conducted space launches all but flawlessly but the per launch cost is more than million according to the government

"2016-05-20 13:02","BREAKING: New report shows Deadbeat Donald didn't pay a dime in tax","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org"," key point the only window into trumpâ s handling of his income taxes came during the new jersey report after trumpâ s application for a casino license state records show that trump claimed that his combined income in and was negative million allowing him to pay no taxes a few years earlier he had told the new york times he was worth more than million washington post drew harwellthe last time donald trumpâ s income tax returns were made public the bottom line was striking he had paid the federal government in income taxes the disclosure in a report by new jersey gambling regulators revealed that the wealthy manhattan investor had for at least two years in the late s taken advantage of a tax code provision popular with developers that allowed him to report negative income today as the presumptive republican presidential nominee trump regularly denounces corporate executives for using loopholes and â false deductions to â get away with murderâ when it comes to avoiding taxes â they make a fortune they pay no tax â trump said last year on cbs â itâ s ridiculous okay â donald trump s evolution on candidate tax returnsthe contrast highlights a potentially awkward challenge for trump he has built a political identity around his reputation as a financial whiz even bragging about his ability to game the tax code to pay as little as possible to the government â a practice he has called the â american way â moreover he has aggressively pursued tax breaks and other government supports to bolster his real estate empire but that history threatens to collide with his efforts to woo working class voters who resent that they often pay higher tax rates than the wealthy who benefit from special loopholes trumpâ s personal taxes are a mystery he has refused to release any recent returns meaning the public cannot see how much money he makes how much he gives to charity and how aggressively he uses deductions shelters and other tactics to shrink his tax bill trump who said last week on abc that his tax rate is â none of your business â would be the first major party nominee in years to not release his returns in an interview this week trump said that he has paid â substantialâ taxes but declined to provide specifics he reiterated that he fights â very hard to pay as little tax as possible â â one of the reasons is because the government takes your money and wastes it in the middle east and all over the place â he said trumpâ s contradictory approaches have been apparent for years he criticized the republican nominee mitt romney for delaying the release of his returns romney a former private equity executive had come under fire for paying a low tax rate because most of his income came from investments â itâ s a great thing when you can show that youâ ve been successful and that youâ ve made a lot of money â trump said at the time romney eventually released returns showing that for his taxes he chose not to take certain deductions bringing his tax rate more in line with that of average americans trump early in his campaign seemed ready to give voters a look at his tax filings in january he said on nbcâ s â meet the pressâ that he was ready to disclose his â very big â â very beautifulâ returns but as his campaign gained momentum trump backed away from his promise he first claimed that ongoing audits by the internal revenue service prevent disclosure then last week he told the associated press that voters are not interested in seeing his tax filings and that â thereâ s nothing to learn from them â trumpâ s new position has unnerved some tax experts who see value in the tradition of transparency by presidential contenders â at some point he could be the tax collector in chief heâ d supervise the irs making sure all of us live up to our own tax responsibilities â said joe thorndike a director at tax analysts a nonpartisan nonprofit group that specializes in tax policy â people deserve to know â â how a person like that plays the game â trumpâ s stance has become an issue in the campaign trumpâ s likely democratic opponent hillary clinton who has disclosed decades of tax returns released a second ad last week asking â whatâ s donald trump hiding â â youâ ve got to ask yourself â why doesnâ t he want to release it â â clinton said at a new jersey rally last week â yeah well weâ re gonna find out â bob mcintyre of the liberal group citizens for tax justice suspects trumpâ s tax returns if made public would undermine the political image the candidate has crafted of a brilliant businessman with what his campaign has called â tremendous cash flow â trump may be worried that â heâ d show very little income on his tax returns compared to his wealth claims â mcintyre said adding that trumpâ s returns could also show that he â writes off everything he has in his life â the hairdo the plane â as business expenses â trump has repeatedly said that he would be open to sharing his returns in he said he would release them after barack obama released his long form birth certificate but never did after the certificateâ s release in he said he would â absolutelyâ release them â if i decide to run for office â last year he said he would release them when â we find out the true story on hillaryâ s emails â to back his refusal trump has released a letter from his tax lawyers that said his tax returns had been audited by the irs since and that audits on the returns since were still underway the lawyersâ letter also said returns from to had been closed administratively by the irs meaning their audits had been completed trump said in an interview he would still not release those returns because â theyâ re all linked â but experts say that trump is free to release his tax records president richard nixon released his returns while under audit nothing including an audit â prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information â an irs spokesman said the only window into trumpâ s handling of his income taxes came during the new jersey report after trumpâ s application for a casino license state records show that trump claimed that his combined income in and was negative million allowing him to pay no taxes a few years earlier he had told the new york times he was worth more than million tax analysts say it is possible that trump pays very low income taxes or no taxes at all using tactics available to wealthy investors and developers such as depreciating the value of real estate when asked this week whether he pays income taxes trump said â i will give that to you as soon as i get my audit finished â he added later â but with that being said when youâ re in the real estate business you do have certain tax advantages â trump has benefited from public money by aggressively seeking large tax reductions at developments including trump tower his first major development the grand hyatt hotel in midtown manhattan built in partnership with chicagoâ s wealthy pritzker family was made possible with the help of a new york city tax subsidy worth million over years according to city records trump has defended his use of public tax assistance to boost private projects he said opponents of such government supports including some conservatives are out of touch with reality â the true conservative philosophy is that a thing like that shouldnâ t happen but theyâ re in the world of the make believe â trump said in an interview â the real world is that without certain tax abatements you have a choice the job could get built â â or you donâ t have to have anything it could just go stagnant and a town can die â trumpâ s strategy to ease his companyâ s tax burden has resulted in sore feelings in some communities where local governments rely heavily on tax receipts from large businesses in ossining n y home to a trump national golf club town officials say that a tax break being sought by the company would cost their coffers more than a year in seeking the reduction trumpâ s lawyers have claimed that the club is worth far less than the roughly million value assessed by the city trumpâ s lawyers have filed papers with the state claiming that the â full market valueâ of the property is million the same golf course appears on trumpâ s new financial disclosure form released this week as part of his presidential campaign â valued by him at more than million trump lawyer alan garten did not respond to questions about the discrepancy ossining town supervisor dana levenberg a democrat expressed frustration that trump seemed to be gaining â at other peopleâ s loss â â itâ s hard to look at someone who talks

matter movement finds influencing contest a challenge the protest organization drew no mention during the second gop presidential debate â there were more than words uttered during the three hour republican presidential primary debate wednesday night none of them were black lives matter for more than a year the nation has been locked in a passionate discussion about race and policing driven by the killing of unarmed black men and women by police officers but as underscored wednesday night the movement that has funneled thousands of protesters into american streets prompted new scrutiny of law enforcement and forced democratic presidential candidates into several stumbles on the trail has yet to receive significant attention in the gop race how to best influence the presidential contest remains a challenge for activists and organizers working under the black lives matter banner in part because different factions of the movement disagree starkly over the best way to do so those tactical disagreements will be front and center this weekend during the congressional black caucus foundation s annual policy conference which features an expansive list of panels with participants as diverse as protesters and policymakers who have risen to prominence during the current protest movement the real goal is to drive the narrative around the presidential debate said nick mosby the baltimore city council member who represents the neighborhood where riots erupted this spring after the death of freddie gray of an injury he suffered while in police custody and that s really hard several protest groups have vowed to continue staging demonstrations at candidates public appearances a tactic that has drawn significant criticism in political and protest circles other activists including deray mckesson who is perhaps the nation s most widely recognized protester linked to the movement have focused on policy meetings pressuring candidates to engage on the details of policing and criminal justice on wednesday mckesson was among activists who met separately with sen bernie sanders i vt and valerie jarrett a senior adviser to president obama to discuss campaign zero their policing and criminal justice policy platform the movement have brought issues of police and criminal justice to the forefront in ways that we haven t seen in decades mckesson said all of the campaigns will continue to need to think deeply about the issues that the unrest has brought to the fore and on friday a new bipartisan group comprising young black lawmakers and public professionals will arrive in washington to meet with the democratic and republican national committees with the hope of succeeding where they think the young activists have fallen short thus far getting the gop candidates to take policing reform seriously the republican candidates are not the only ones under pressure some of the movement s biggest headlines of the summer came when members interrupted democratic candidates sanders and martin o malley during a liberal policy conference organized in phoenix by the group netroots nation our group was pretty much solidified after the netroots situation said ashley bell who is one of two chairs of leaders of america an alliance of young black elected officials and policymakers that is evenly composed of democrats and republicans but the disruptive protests were not an unqualified success they drew criticism from many on both sides of the political aisle causing some who want to see policing and criminal justice reform to worry that the protest movement would not be taken seriously by presidential candidates there was a lot of concern that we needed to make sure the candidates had a venue and marketplace to talk about these issues said bell a republican and former county commissioner in hall county ga the next president might not be african american if not we need to make sure the next president understands the issues that affect black communities bell said his group has held preliminary policy talks with the presidential campaigns of sen rand paul r ky and gov scott walker r wisc the group has also invited the candidates to a presidential forum in november at allen university in south carolina an rnc official confirmed wednesday that during the meeting friday will present policy proposals on policing and criminal justice that are being considered for inclusion in the republican party s party platform we definitely have a long way to go said aja brown the mayor of compton calif who is in washington this week we have to get to that moment where all of the candidates are really discussing the issues at the forefront of the national headlines so we can have a candid conversation about race education and economic opportunity in two debates that stretched for a combined five hours the candidates in the republican presidential field were asked just one question about what some on the left consider a new civil rights movement it was wildly disappointing for them to have a three hour debate wednesday and not once bring up these issues which have completely altered the national conversation mckesson said on wednesday night the only time the word police was uttered by a candidate was during a response by paul about medical marijuana the most memorable of just a handful of exchanges about criminal justice reform involved jeb bush s apology to his mother for smoking marijuana years ago our country is at a fork in the road said chelsi henry a conservative columnist for ebony magazine and a member of these issues have come up during presidential elections before what makes it so unique this time around is that we want to see more than a talking point that has been the message delivered consistently by mckesson and the others who came to prominence as activists after the fatal police shooting of michael brown in ferguson mo in that message was the focus of their sit down with sanders on wednesday the activists who met with sanders were mckesson johnetta elzie brittany packnett and samuel sinyangwe the team behind campaign zero as well as erika totten a washington based activist and organizer and martinez sutton the brother of rekia boyd an unarmed black woman who was shot and killed by an off duty police officer in chicago in after that session mckesson elzie and packnett went to the white house and met with jarrett and roy austin jr the deputy assistant to the president for urban affairs in a meeting that included phillip agnew of the dream defenders and jamye wooten of baltimore united for change we ve seen broad engagement with campaign zero at all levels of the politics mckesson said i m encouraged and i m hopeful that the conversation with the white house is a beginning and will result in tangible things that affect these issues the conversation only matters if it informs practice that impacts people s lives campaign zero has earned the praise of prominent democratic operatives and some activists but it has also drawn the skepticism of some activists not involved in it highlighting significant divisions among the young activists there is no doubt in my mind that our country must be aggressive in addressing institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system sanders said in a statement after his meeting with the activists i look forward to a continuing dialogue with campaign zero and other voices from communities of color to address deeply entrenched racial and economic problems in our country sanders and hillary rodham clinton the front runner in the democratic presidential race are aggressively courting black voters who were crucial to the obama coalition it s not going to be easy to get our votes patrisse cullors another police reform activist said in a previous interview but if they re feeling compelled to meet with the people who have been leading the black lives matter movement then things are headed in the right

"2016-05-13 07:14","Trump campaign eyes #NeverTrump blacklist","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," trump campaign eyes nevertrump blacklistby kenneth p vogel and ben schreckinger am edt donald trump s campaign is considering hitting his republican enemies where it hurts their wallets as trump moves to work in closer concert with the republican national committee apparatus some campaign aides and allies are pushing him to block lucrative party contracts from consultants who worked to keep him from winning the nomination according to four sources familiar with the discussions the never trump vendors and supporters shouldn t be in striking distance of the rnc any of its committees or anyone working on behalf of donald trump said a trump campaign official the blacklist talk which sources say mostly targets operatives who worked for never trump groups but also some who worked for trump s gop presidential rivals or their supportive super pacs strikes against a republican consulting class that trump has assailed as a pillar of a corrupt political establishment it s a sweet bit of turnabout for trump aides and consultants who in recent months were warned that their work for the anti establishment billionaire real estate showman could diminish their own career prospects if trump s team makes good on the blacklist it could elevate a whole new crop of vendors while penalizing establishment operatives who attacked him often in deeply personal terms but it also could put trump s campaign at a competitive disadvantage as it scrambles to quickly beef up capabilities in highly technical campaign tactics that it largely eschewed in the primary including voter data direct mail and phone banking newly minted presidential nominees typically install staff at their respective parties national committees and have been known to steer contracts to at least some of their favored vendors which often provokes backlash since trump all but clinched the gop nomination this month with a lopsided victory in indiana s primary his staffers including political director rick wiley have spent considerable time at the rnc s capitol hill headquarters discussing joint fundraising and field operations the trump campaign did not respond to questions about preferred vendors sources in and around the campaign told politico that the campaign was not going to try to enforce a blanket blacklist for all consultants who opposed trump but rather would make contracting decisions on a case by case basis with those associated with harder hitting attacks more likely to be barred some of the consultants and firms that worked against trump are industry leaders in their respective fields including strategist katie packer pollster the tarrance group online fundraiser campaign solutions and data vendors targetpoint and targeted victory together the consultants and firms this year have been paid at least by the leading anti trump super pac our principles pac which pales in comparison to the million their firms have collected over the years from the rnc according to a politico analysis of federal election commission filings packer who helped run our principles pac said she has no interest in working for trump nor do those i know who worked against him so it wouldn t bother her one bit to be on a trump blacklist i just hope they put me at the top and spell my name correctly she said adding winning a presidential election is hard they should focus on that and worry about settling scores if they win but targetpoint which has been paid at least this year by our principles pac as compared to at least million over the years by the rnc would welcome the chance to continue its relationship with the national party during trump s campaign said brent seaborn a partner at the firm we have built a lot and have a lot planned and i would hate to see that not developed so i certainly hope that we continue with that work he said officials from the tarrance group and campaign solutions declined to say whether they would work for a trump led rnc zac moffatt president of targeted victory said that his firm merely rented email lists to our principles for which it has been paid through the end of march the period covered by the most recent fec filings the firm has been paid more than that by the trump campaign for processing online donations moffatt pointed out though he acknowledged it was more involved in the presidential campaign of trump s bitter rival ted cruz which paid million to targeted victory for digital advertising and fundraising nonetheless moffatt said he hopes targeted victory will be able to play a role in the general election with the rnc which over the years has paid the firm million with the party s convention committees paying targeted victory another to assist with their web presences that includes from the convention committee for setting up a tumblr page of course we would work for the rnc under trump said moffatt he is our nominee and we have been building our plus person company to prepare for the general for the past four years i would think the party and the campaign would want to best team available to complement their efforts where they see needs rnc chief strategist sean spicer said that senior trump campaign officials have assured him there is no list of firms they do not want the party committee to use there has been no discussion of not using any vendors pro or con he said but some of trump s close allies are publicly accusing republican leaders including rnc chairman reince priebus of trying to block trump s campaign from making rnc contracting decisions partly by withholding key endorsements like that of house speaker paul ryan with whom trump met thursday at the rnc this is really about the money at the rnc trump confidant roger stone alleged in a little noticed online interview this week millions and millions and millions of dollars that reince and ryan want to hand out to favored vendors so they are going to try to game plan trump they re going to try to barter paul ryan s endorsement in return for financial control and autonomy for the rnc the republican national committee that would be an egregious mistake in my opinion but this is part and parcel of the establishment effort to slow down donald trump the doling out of lucrative contracts to well connected firms is a perennial source of friction in washington politics in past years contracts awarded by the rnc to fls connect llc while its former partner rich beeson served as the committee s political director have come under scrutiny as have contracts awarded to operative blaise hazelwood s husband when hazelwood worked at the rnc and the national republican senatorial committee this is again one of those issues that the rnc has to be cognizant of because those old cozy relationships are part of the problem and trump has effectively run on that said michael steele a former rnc chairman who made discontent with the committee s handling of vendor relationships a theme of his campaign for that post you re probably going to see a lot of that stuff get exposed or dealt with in some way but another gop digital strategist cast these political consulting blacklists as folly he pointed to the relationship between an anti trump super pac and a firm co founded last year by gerrit lansing before he became the rnc s chief digital officer the firm an online payment platform called revv processed donations at nevertrump com the website for never means never pac an anti trump group seeded with from pierre omidyar the founder of ebay and first look media lansing has had no ties to revv since joining the rnc last summer he did not respond to a request for comment with revv doing never trump you have to ask yourself is the rnc on the blacklist too asked the strategist the idea of a blacklist doesn t make any sense because no it s ill informed and no it doesn t reflect the marketplace plus the trump camp s desire for revenge could run up against the businessman s pledge to surround himself with the best people in the case of lansing who worked at the national republican congressional committee before the rnc trump appears to be a fan in february the new york billionaire tweeted i am hearing that nrcc digital director lansing is doing great work expanding and modernizing gop social media good we need it to view online "

the mississippi flag announcement and yesterdayâ s vote about cemeteries generated virtually no press coverage and little protest this reflects a remarkable sea change when you think back to what a huge issue the flag was in the not so distant past such as south carolinaâ s republican primary in it was a non issue in the presidential contest in a moment when few elected republicans are willing to stand up to donald trump yesterdayâ s vote is also a potent reminder of how much principled leadership can make a real difference gov nikki haleyâ s courageous willingness to touch what had been a third rail in her state changed the tenor of the whole conversation though a majority of his members opposed yesterdayâ s measure speaker paul ryan allowed it to come up for a vote on the floor forcing them to take a tough vote and signaled his personal support also with little fanfare the florida legislature passed a bill to remove the statue of a confederate general from the u s capitol

uncomfortable with the â tâ part of the lgbt acronym what a difference a year makes like haley the supreme courtâ s decision to legalize gay marriage in all statesâ made possible because anthony kennedy mindful of his legacy â provided the fifth voteâ has dramatically changed the discourse yesterday around the same time as the confederate cemetery vote the house erupted when republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity the proposal authored by openly gay rep sean maloney d n y looked like it was about to pass it had the votes on the big board but then the republicans kept the vote open longer and six gop members switched from yes to no so it could be defeated on a to vote watch this minute video of the scene as democrats chanted â shameâ at their republican

legislation during a special session thought requiring people to use the bathroom of their birth gender was overwhelmingly popular among voters they have been wildly caught off guard by the continuing backlash unlike the confederate flag transgender issues did break through in the presidential contest recall that only a few weeks ago trump said he thought the bathroom law was a bad idea and cruz

churchill downs in louisvilleâ last week â ap photo garry jones the big idea as she campaigns in kentucky ahead of tuesdayâ s primary hillary clinton has repeatedly slammed republican gov matt bevin on everything from health care to education the businessman elected unexpectedly last fall with promises to shake up frankfort has signaled that he wants to dismantle the state health exchange set up by his democratic predecessor and move kentuckians into the insurance market managed by the federal government heâ s in negotiations with the u s department of health and human services when clinton brings up bevin at rallies democratic crowds boo â i am saddened by what i hear may come out of the governorâ s office here in kentucky â she said in louisville this week she even went to a family health center in louisville to talk with doctors and draw attention to the issue â i have to tell you it just brought tears to my eyes â she recalled to a crowd later in the day â people who are getting health care for the first time in years â and it is so distressing to me when anybody in public life who has all the health care he or she needs wants to take it away from poor people working poor people small business people and others who donâ t have the health care they need â bill clinton knocked bevin yesterday during a three city swing across the bluegrass state and his wife plans to do so again when she returns on sunday and monday hillary clinton speaks with bill wagner executive director of family health centers during a tour of his facility in louisville on tuesday â ap photo patrick semansky bevin in an interview with the pushed back strongly against the clintons he argues that heâ s not trying to take health coverage from anyone but working to make care more affordable and accessible â an insurance card does not make you healthy â he said â you can crow about expanding this and that but it doesnâ t matter if you donâ t improve outcomes â and at the end of the day it does have to be paid for itâ s not cheap â â the clintons have been surrounded by corruption their entire political lives â the governor said â i donâ t use the term corruption lightly â go back to arkansas and follow the trail â go back to whitewater look at the foundations look at the pay to play â bevin is a self made millionaire who owns several businesses â people like them have become extremely wealthy by milking their connections â he complained he also said clinton attacks him on health care so that the media does not cover her gaffe about putting lots of coal miners out of work â she wants to destroy a key part of our state â he said â she wants to see coal wiped off the face of the earth â gov bevin can resort to personal attacks but hillary clinton is going to remain focused on laying out how she ll fight for kentucky families as president â her spokesman ian sams responded â her commitment to tackling the challenges that young and working families face in accessing affordable health care and child care is quite a contrast with a republican governor intent on taking away people s health insurance and cutting critical funding for higher education donald trump arrives for his meeting with paul ryan yesterday brendan smialowski afp getty images though few other elected officials still talk this way bevin maintains that no one has the republican nomination definitely locked up until the convention in cleveland which he plans to attend â let me see who it will be â he said when asked whether he will support donald trump â more than the party iâ m interested in people who are conservative sadly the most conservative people are no longer in the race â i asked bevin if he considers trump a conservative â iâ ll let people make their own determination on that â he said then he referenced matthew â you can judge a tree by the fruit it bears â he said while bevin may not be sold on trump his dripping disdain for both clintons is genuine and deep this he made clear to me will eventually get him off the sidelines it may also be one of the reasons why so many elected republicans ultimately unite behind the donald â iâ ve been very very very clear from the beginning until now in no way shape or form do i want to see hillaryâ or bernieâ get elected â bevin said â the future of america is on trial â we get the government we deserve â

strategies deployed by the republicans felled by trump including that of the former florida governor whose passivity in the face of trump s taunts and insults doomed his once inevitable seeming campaign they also took notes as sen marco rubio tried and failed to match trump in an unflattering game of personal insults after donald trump s convincing win in the republican party s indiana state primary this week and the departure of his main rival ted cruz from the race it appears he really will be hillary clinton s rival for the us presidency however surreal it might still be to some his victory has many republicans leaving the party and even burning their voter registration cards for clinton the question now becomes how to best attack trump luckily for her recent months have provided plenty of fodder in two early attack ads she s letting trump himself and his republican detractors do the work for her without clinton herself appearing once in either ad bernie sandersthe democratic race is just about over bernie sanders won indiana tuesday night but essentially split the delegates with hillary clinton who now has percent of the delegates she needs for the nomination but sanders

election has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against hillary clinton mr trump who is expected to run on a nonideological platform of his own design is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the republican nominee and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign his team already working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential campaign apparatus has been reaching out to members of congress and washington think tanks strategizing on how best to take on mrs clinton and woo supporters of her primary opponent senator bernie sanders of vermont and planning to head to cleveland next week to help direct the party s july convention according to aides donald trump suggested wednesday that he would be open to lifting the minimum wage switching his previous primary campaign stance that the u s could not afford to hike the current federal rate of per hour asked specifically if he was open to raising the minimum wage during an interview with cnn s wolf blitzer trump responded i am open to doing something with it because i don t like that but he added what i really do like is bring our jobs back so they re making much more than the dollars sen ben sasse r neb has said what many other gop senators and officials undoubtedly wanted to say but have opted not to donald trump could be a disaster for

transit disaster preparedness â€” PTC gets shoutout in FCC reauthorization markup","morningtransportation@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by martine powers am edtwith help from heather caygle lauren gardner kate tummarello and jennifer scholtesshuster clinches narrow victory after a nail biter of an election night house transportation chairman bill shuster just barely eked out a win against opponent art halvorson in pennsylvania s primary on tuesday nabbing percent of the vote his win however narrow has some significant implications as politico s jake sherman reports shuster s victory is a coup for republicans fearful of losing an influential member of the party who is close with leadership but the primary outcome also means that shuster will be sticking around for at least a couple more years and his fight to privatize u s air traffic control operations may yet garner major discussion even if shuster is not able to push through his bill by the end of this congress from his statement i am honored to represent a region that i have called home my entire life and i thank the people of the th district for electing me to represent the republican party in the election this november shuster said my campaign focused on a positive message of conservative solutions that cut spending and put up a roadblock to president obama s disastrous agenda and i won t stop fighting for these values back to business and now that the primary is over shuster is expected to return his sights to the faa bill senate commerce chairman john thune said he s eager to hear about shuster s game plan going forward our staffs have talked and i think they tried to arrange to visit to talk about next steps on some stuff including faa reauthorization thune said that will happen probably later this week it s wednesday good morning and thanks for tuning into politico s morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains planes automobiles and ports you knew it was only a matter of time until mt found a transportation themed lyric in lemonade did we miss any others let us know mpowers politico com or martinepowers and we rode motorcycles blackjack classic vinyl tough girl is what i had to be dropped with a thud it s official the transportation housing and urban development appropriations bill is next on the docket on the senate floor senate majority leader mitch mcconnell filed cloture on the motion to proceed tuesday night earlier in the day mcconnell brushed off a question from reporter about whether a zika virus response measure would get tacked on to the bill we haven t yet concluded how much or when but we all are very much aware that this is a serious crisis mcconnell said west coast dispatch former nhtsa chief david strickland will speak at today s california hearing on driverless cars representing the new lobbying group called the self driving coalition for safer streets backed by ride sharing rivals uber and lyft along with google ford and volvo strickland who serves as the nascent group s counsel and spokesman said he s going to emphasize the opportunity nhtsa has to show leadership and help discourage a patchwork of laws that would slow down or significantly delay the implementation of fully self driving cars it s not decades away it s years away maybe a handful of years away he told heather in an interview about when he thinks driverless cars will hit the mass market strickland who was nhtsa s chief when it issued the guidance on driverless cars which seems luddite like compared to what the agency is pursuing now said the technology has changed so fast necessitating an update to further define the federal role at the time in that was the right approach he told heather i think what they ve seen at nhtsa now is a maturity of the technology birds of a feather so how hard was it to get super rivals uber and lyft on board the fact that you have competitors that are very successful as individual companies and feel the need to have this powerful coalition it speaks to that the time is now he said updates from the house floor legislation that would order the tsa to size up security at foreign airports with flights directly to the united states was passed by a voice vote in the house on tuesday it is no secret that terror groups across the world value the horrific symbolism of bringing down an aircraft and are continuously plotting to take down planes rep john katko the author of the bill h r said on the floor they recognize that it is easier for them to take down an aircraft destined for the united states from overseas rather than travel to the united states and then plot a domestic attack busy day the house also passed the prepare act h r which would among other things require public transportation agencies that receive federal grants to follow enhanced regulations on disaster preparedness from major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and schools my district is vulnerable to a variety of man made and natural disasters said rep donald payne jr our community s first responders must be prepared to respond to every worst case scenario missing the mark up the maritime administration reauthorization bill is up for a markup by the senate commerce committee today the legislation is heavy on administrative changes to the u s merchant marine academy but light on provisions related to infrastructure to me it s a little disappointing said john n young of the american association of port authorities when mt asked him about the bill on tuesday there s a lot more that the maritime administration is doing than what s reflected in the reauthorization bill one amendment on the docket from sen roger wicker would require an annual report outlining what happens to the money that s collected from the sale of retired government vessels it s a two fer the fcc reauthorization bill is also on the schedule for the senate commerce markup and there s one measure up for consideration that will be of particular interest to the rail industry an amendment by sen roy blunt that directs the fcc to make a rule to exempt modest size positive train control projects from having to go through the environmental and historical review process part of an effort to streamline ptc implementation as the tv channel turns ntsb chairman christopher hart responded to sen lisa murkowski s questions to the agency tuesday about its involvement in a docu series or reality show from the alaska republican s pov about plane crash investigations in her home state general aviation is the main way alaskans move about the sparsely paved state and murkowski and some state tourism advocates fear the show presents a skewed view of the safety of air travel there in addition to offering a defense of the participation in the documentaries the ntsb argued that the tv show could encourage more accident witnesses to provide information to officials like cellphone pictures or video when situations arise the agency also noted that ntsb officials discussed the series with staffers from murkowski s and sen dan sullivan s offices in june during a meeting on a range of subjects the agency studied rough cuts of each episode and found they lived up to the production agreement it had established with the film crew which was intended to ensure the show wouldn t be shot in a reality tv style format that could sensationalize events ntsb had sole authority to select investigations to be featured in the series based on interviews the board has no reason to believe its investigators or the producer misled any third parties present at the accident sites such as family members about the purpose of the filming but vowed to investigate further if murkowski s staff can provide information supporting any such allegations to murkowski s concern about the show s depiction of general aviation in alaska ntsb said the episodes individually and the series as a whole present an accurate account of the ntsb s aviation accident investigation process the episodes and the series do not provide a valid basis to support conclusions about the overall safety of general aviation in alaska a call for compromise european commissioner for transport violeta bulc said tuesday that the eu nations will have to be willing to compromise to strike an agreement on capping airplane emissions according to politico europe s anca gurzu achieving all of our objectives will be quite challenging substantial negotiating effort will be needed she told the european parliament s environment committee we need to stay ambitious but we also need to be flexible and be ready to compromise at stake is a global and market based plan the u n s international civil aviation organization hopes will cap carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector at levels bulc said the current proposal has a good basis in finding a balance between icao s principle of not discriminating among airline carriers while also respecting developing countries more limited capabilities to contribute to a global deal flint aid finds a home in wrda after ricocheting around the senate for months a deal to help flint mich and other cities with aging and failing water distribution systems was written into the water resources development act unveiled by the senate environment and public works committee tuesday pro s annie snider reports the bill which is traditionally filled with projects for the army corps of engineers this year includes a major update of the country s clean water and drinking water programs including a new million five year grant program dedicated to lead pipe replacement the epa would be charged with implementing that program along with a new trust fund drawing private money for fixing water and sewer problems and the bill directs epa to rethink the financial impact of upgrades it requires does it have a chance this year s wrda is a last hurrah for epw chairman jim inhofe who is term limited out of the chairmanship this year and ranking member barbara boxer who is retiring the two have clearly decided to go out with a bang but whether their influence can overcome many republicans dislike of epa and government spending remains to be seen wrda in the house the house transportation and infrastructure committee has yet to unveil its version of wrda but chairman bill shuster has shown less interest in dealing with municipal water infrastructure issues suggesting his bill will be narrow your uber trip subsidized the center for american progress plans to release a report today that calls on congress to support legislation that would allow some public transit agencies to use federal funding to pay for ride sharing services from companies such as uber and lyft for people living in low income communities that are poorly served by transit for the most economically disadvantaged individuals and families gaining access to

rates for the wealthy later adding during the interview on abc news â i donâ t mind paying more tax â he moved to clarify his comments monday morning telling cnn that high earners would still get tax

crooked hillaryâ as the latest triumph in a series after â lyinâ ted â â liddle marcoâ and â low energy jeb â the nicknames that he affixed to his vanquished republican rivals ted cruz marco rubio and

given that this is the new york times or as he calls us on twitter the â failing new york times â to be more precise actually trump wants me to include that not only is this the â failing new york

as billion for the fall campaign but that he will seek to raise it from donors rather than continue to self finance but mr trump has no fund raising apparatus to resort to no network of prolific bundlers to call upon and little known experience with the type of marathon one on one serial salesmanship and solicitousness that raising so much money is likely to require â even if individuals can

view of him itâ s the same story according to gallup womenâ s distaste for mr trump has crept up from percent last july to percent in april and a washington post abc news poll from april showed that a

second guest represent his most extensive comments so far about the presidential race in which donald j trump has emerged as the presumptive republican nominee mr singer was among a group of donors who had funded efforts to stop mr trumpâ s campaign but the comments also reflect a conversation that is beginning among writers elected officials and donors over how to protect the conservative

times paul krugmantruly donald trump knows nothing he is more ignorant about policy than you can possibly imagine even when you take into account the fact that he is more ignorant than you can possibly imagine but his ignorance isnâ t as unique as it may seem in many ways heâ s just doing a clumsy job of channeling nonsense widely popular in his party and to some extent in the chattering classes more generally last week the presumptive republican presidential nominee â hard to believe but there it is â finally revealed his plan to make america great again basically it involves running the country like a failing casino he could he asserted â make a dealâ with creditors that would reduce the debt burden if his outlandish promises of economic growth donâ t work out the reaction from everyone who knows anything about finance or economics was a mix of amazed horror and horrified amazement one does not casually suggest throwing away americaâ s carefully cultivated reputation as the worldâ s most scrupulous debtor â a reputation that dates all the way back to alexander hamilton washington post eugene robinsonhow do you nail a blob of mercury to the wall thatâ s a problem the democratic nominee â likely hillary clinton â will have to solve in running against donald trump most of whose positions on major issues are shall we say elusive i say â mostâ because trump has been steadfast on three of his most nonsensical promises banning muslims from entering the country forcing mexico to pay for a border wall and deporting million undocumented immigrants many of his supporters surely know he could not possibly do any of those things if elected president but some donâ t â and would feel betrayed if trump suddenly dropped the whole xenophobia thing on other issues however trying to pin trump down on what he believes or intends has been an exercise in futility this is a problem not only for clinton but also for republicans who would like to support trump for the sake of unity but want some idea of where the party is being led trump may figure that if he does enough flip flopping and zigzagging and blowing of smoke voters will become inured â a strategy of

every death sentence imposed in that state since when the supreme court reversed its brief moratorium on executions and allowed them to resume racism has always been at the heart of the american death

"2016-05-18 07:19","Trump aides' rivalries plague super PACs","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," trump aides rivalries plague super pacsby kenneth p vogel and ben schreckinger am edtthe power struggle inside donald trump s presidential campaign is spilling over into the world of his super pac allies freezing wealthy supporters who want to write big checks to boost the presumptive gop nominee over likely democratic opponent hillary clinton top trump adviser paul manafort has privately expressed support for a yet to be launched super pac that would be affiliated with a close friend of the billionaire multiple sources familiar with the matter said manafort s allies hope the pac will become the favored vehicle for huge checks from mega donors like las vegas casino mogul sheldon adelson who is believed to be considering spending as much as million boosting trump but the sources said that manafort s chief internal rival trump campaign manager corey lewandowski who is close to adelson s advisers is not on board with the plan for the new pac and they suggest that if lewandowski doesn t like the set up he may signal his support for a totally different outside spending vehicle possibly one that hasn t even been created yet an adviser to adelson whose donations are being closely watched as a bellwether to other donors told politico we are not anywhere near a decision on who will receive money or how much we will give adelson will make his own decision independent of trump campaign aides signals the adviser said neither manafort lewandowski nor the trump campaign responded to requests for comment about the lack of clear signals from the campaign about a preferred super pac trump allies fear that continued confusion could cripple their slow starting big money fundraising effort which has been plagued by infighting it s an especially acute problem for trump since he eschewed fundraising and openly antagonized the gop donor class during his mostly self funded primary campaign allowing clinton and her allies to build a massive cash advantage using a quartet of super pacs working closely together to fill well defined roles the four main super pacs devoted to clinton have combined to raise million from the beginning of last year through the end of march the period covered by the most recent fec filings and the leading pro clinton super pac priorities usa action has already reserved million in television ad time in key swing states for tough general election ads against trump by contrast more than two dozen mostly unauthorized outside groups that claim to support trump have raised a total of million this cycle but only six of the groups have actually bought ads supporting trump and because trump had disavowed all super pacs until recently his advisers haven t given donors much indication about which if any outside groups they prefer one of the few pro trump super pacs to gain any momentum great america pac was seen within gop finance circles as having a tacit blessing from lewandowski while the group had struggled to raise cash and was in the red at the end of march it had begun establishing itself in recent weeks as the leading vehicle in a growing field of pro trump super pacs that features many entrants using the candidate s name to raise money while spending little in support of his campaign former texas gov rick perry is scheduled to participate in a donor conference call for great america pac on wednesday according to an invitation obtained by politico and the group announced a donor retreat at the ranch of billionaire texas energy investor t boone pickens but as great america pac has gained credibility and started winning support from key donors manafort s allies have stepped up their attacks on it as a scam and some have expressed support for competing groups including one launched last week called the committee to restore american sovereignty the pacs that legitimately want to help trump need to figure out a way to work together or they will end up squandering cash on competing efforts warned the influential gop mega donor stanley s hubbard the minnesota broadcasting billionaire this month joined the advisory committee of great america pac and on tuesday he told politico that he had written a six figure check to the group he added that he was open to giving more but said he would not give to other pro trump super pacs if they call me they re wasting their time because one is enough too many cooks in the kitchen ruin the stew he said suggesting that the super pac competition is less about tactics and more about personality what you have to do is keep ego out of it i think ego creeps into too many things any attempts to create clarity in the super pac derby and to shut down scammers who are raising money off of trump are complicated by federal election rules barring super pacs and other big money groups from coordinating with candidates and their campaigns or party committees a trump campaign official said uncertainty about the universe of pro trump pacs and the dark figures involved is deterring major donors who previously supported trump s vanquished gop presidential rivals including chris christie jeb bush and john kasich they re all waiting for the right vehicle said the official the fact of the matter is that we just have a hodgepodge nobody s eager to throw their money down a rat hole the official suggested that this problem could be solved by the entrance of a super pac blessed by manafort and affiliated with california real estate billionaire named thomas barrack a close ally of trump s barrack has had discussions with manafort and others about becoming involved in a new super pac according to sources in and around the campaign barrack who has praised the presumptive gop nominee s charm and emotional intelligence and is set to host a fundraiser for trump this month in los angeles was traveling internationally tuesday and could not be reached for comment the trump campaign official added tom barrack is one of trump s friends and there s a lot of concerns about fingers that are in these pies nobody trusts anybody in these non affiliated groups and trump trusts barrack implicitly but even if barrack who has not previously been a major donor scattering among democratic and republican campaigns over the years puts his full weight into an outside spending effort that has manafort s blessing some trump allies fear that may not quash the rivalries between the super pacs which reflect deep personal tensions beyond the manafort leandowski rift manafort and his allies have a tricky decades long history with the leaders of great america pac and the committee to restore american sovereignty during ronald reagan s reelection campaign manafort and his close ally roger stone worked together sometimes uneasily with ed rollins the co chairman of great america pac and doug watts the national executive director of the committee to restore american sovereignty stone s ex wife ann stone also has discussed launching a super pac that will work to win over women to vote for trump a source familiar with the effort told politico the source said stone is working with amy kremer who formerly was associated with great america and kathryn serkes and that they have suggested their effort has an unofficial blessing from trump s campaign ann stone kremer and serkes did not respond to requests for comment nor did a trump campaign spokesperson after watts announced the creation of his super pac rollins pushed back releasing a statement this week predicting that his great america pac will be the best funded most effective independent committee supporting trump s candidacy roger stone lashed back calling great america a scam pac and pointing out that one of its advisers was convicted of a campaign finance violation this month while rollins had worked as an adviser to a firm started by a former bill clinton aide but eric beach great america s co chairman pointed to trump s praise of rollins as tremendous earlier this month as a sign that the businessman views the group favorably while the mega donor hubbard said having rollins on board is a selling point he s certainly had a lot of experience a rollins ally suggested that stone helped create the committee to restore american sovereignty as a way to undermine great america pac and rollins himself suggested that stone is obsessed with him asserting i don t spend my life tracking roger stone he may spend his life tracking me but i don t spend my life tracking him stone did not directly respond to questions about his role in the committee to restore american sovereignty but he did say he planned to contribute to the group and he questioned the depth of rollins commitment to trump rollins will end up attacking trump stone predicted watts laughed off the suggestion that stone had put him up to creating the pac as a means of undermining rollins ed and i are friends of years and were business partners for a few year so i wouldn t do something that was predicated on that basis watts said both ed and roger have had an obsession with one another over the years i m not sure what the genesis is but it has a life of its own watts countered that his pac s fundraising approach was superior to great america s they re already in debt and i have no idea what their designs are he said but he also said there was room for multiple pro trump outside groups and that barrack s group could be a positive addition to the crowded space three to five super pacs in support of the same candidacy is not a bad thing it means you have a wider net that you re casting for contributions watts said so i welcome it sure alex isenstadt contributed to

who was booted from office in after a drunken and profane run in with police sink removed him as a co host of the fundraiser on wednesday some strategists saw that as a no brainer for a campaign that made a rookie mistake by failing to background big donors others said sink would have created less fuss had she stood by winton and wasn t she was boxing herself in so every donor with a less than perfect profile would be questioned on friday they did turns out that one of the event s co chairs george lindemann wealthy chairman of the bass art musem s board of trustees served time for ordering

charged world of fort lauderdale politics and businessrielle hunter who was born in fort lauderdale years ago has had an alarmingly eventful life as a teenager she was an accomplished equestrienne who rode a champion jumping horse until the animal was electrocuted in its stable by a hit man from chicago part of one of the biggest scandals to ever hit florida s blueblood horse set as a blond and pretty young woman her voracious appetite for cocaine and men caught the attention of novelist jay mcinerney who based a lead character on her in a bestselling book about the excesses of the s now in middle age she s become a notorious national media celebrity as the femme fatale in the scandal that has all but destroyed the political career of former democratic presidential candidate john edwards it s been a wild wandering and wanton life for hunter who spent her childhood in tamarac as lisa jo druck her given name and to understand hunter she married divorced and kept her ex husband s name it s instructive to look back at those years in fort lauderdale specifically at the untold story of her father james druck who was a powerful attorney in downtown fort lauderdale for nearly two decades once the family was transplanted to ocala things only got worse in a particularly nasty turn of events druck hired an assassin named tommy the sandman burns to kill his daughter s horse henry the hawk for the insurance money the event deeply traumatized his daughter who was near the stable when the horse was electrocuted burns later admitted to federal investigators that he had killed about horses one of those sentenced to prison in the case was george lindemann jr a palm beach scion to a billion dollar fortune like druck he also had burns kill a show horse for the insurance money hunter who was with a boyfriend when burns killed the animal saw the horse dead on the stable floor mcinerney fictionalized the account in his book the story of my life the character based on hunter named allison poole recounts that she was so distraught by the killing of the horse named dangerous dan in the book that she had to be kept on tranquilizers for a week the book was published before the edwards scandal broke and the poole character would also be included in american psycho a bestselling novel by bret easton ellis james druck died in of lung cancer before he could be brought to justice on the insurance fraud charge the rest of the story quite literally is history new times broward palm beach convict contributions sen charles schumer d n y has accepted thousands of dollars in

and grandkids can inherit a healthy planet but weâ re not finished weâ ve got so much more to do and weâ ve got to make sure we put the future of our country in the hands of a leader who will work with us to finish what we started together all those years ago lt link gt and i think you and i both know who that person is our nominee for president of the united states hillary clinton lt link gt a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and young girls all across the country hillary clinton embodies the spirit of service she is the fighter we need to keep making

signed off let me know if you have any flags thanks ericâ v ch friend when people support the democratic party they give a lot of reasons why when you gave xx on date to the dnc it might have been because you alt for nds when folks like you give to the dnc itâ s often because you want to protect the progress that weâ ve made over the past seven years or it s because you donâ t want to see million people lose the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care coverage and because you donâ t want to see declining graduation rates for our young people and you donâ t want to see the unprecedented job growth weâ ve experienced over the past months reversed the xx donations youâ ve made in this election alt for nds the donations grassroots supporters have made in this election prove just how committed you are to moving this country forward and we canâ t thank you enough for that every single day folks like you are laying the foundation for some critical wins in november in important races all across the country not just the presidential race weâ re poised to replace governors and senators who are living in the past with democrats whose vision for the future of this country means actually moving this country into the future so right now iâ m coming to you again because we need you name we need you to dig deep and pitch in again before our monthly deadline saturday at midnight can i count on you to pitch in or whatever you can to make sure our candidates have the resources they need to win linksthanks name we canâ t win without you bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committeeâ v ejb â democrats have been pretty fortunate this election cycle name we have two terrific presidential candidates in hillary clinton and bernie sanders making us proud with smart substantive debates and focusing on the issues that really matter itâ s a world of difference from the pettiness and name calling we ve seen on the other side and because republican senators so often refuse to do their jobs weâ ve got a map thatâ s in our favor and a good chance to take back our majority this is all good news but unfortunately republican in fighting hasnâ t distracted them from their desire to beat us â and i know that because itâ s my job to look at the numbers and so far the gop has raised more than million to beat us thatâ s a lot of money name and iâ ll be honest â itâ s more than weâ ve raised but here s a bit more good news thereâ s still time to build the kind of foundation we need to win in november we just need grassroots supporters like you to step up and help us cross that finish line can i count on you to pitch in or more before this next end of month deadline linksthanks so much with the help of supporters like you i know weâ re going to knock this one out of the park bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committeeâ v jgr â friend i m going to be very straightforward with you name we havenâ

lot of money and while we might not catch up to their mega donors we have another resource that matters even more you with grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like or bucks we re slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure that democrats all across the country are going to benefit from come november we re laying the foundation for serious wins and we need to keep going every time someone like you decides to click that donate button and give whatever you can it s another voice telling the rnc and the millionaires and billionaires who are backing them that they can t buy this election we ve got the right candidates and weâ re fighting on the right side of history now we ve just got to see it through til november th so name i m asking you to be one of those voices right now push this button and pitch in or whatever you can to support democrats up and down the ticket all across the country donate buttonthanks a lot bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committeeâ v er â friend â last week the republican national committee released their fec fundraising report from march and i wonâ t mince words we got beat and the republicans have now raised more than million in total all to beat us in november that means this monthâ s deadline just got that much more important we need to start making up the difference now if

patients as opposed to simply the number of tests and procedures provided the proposed regulation issued wednesday is a step towards implementing that new system â the legislation congress passed a little over a year ago was a milestone in our efforts to advance a health care system that rewards better care smarter spending and healthier people â health and human services secretary sylvia burwell â we have more work to do but we are committed to implementing this important legislation and creating a health care system that works better for doctors patients and taxpayers alike â the

clinton and the party platform to the left in the time before the convention democrats close to clintonâ s camp saw sandersâ post results statement tuesday evening as a tacit admission that his role

between idealism and pragmatism between principle and politics between dynamism and incrementalism â though all those things are at play to some degree but to me it is more about where we peg the

indiana but it is likely to have a limited impact on swaying voters or more importantly convention delegates â murray added washington post sean sullivanted cruz just suffered one of the worst drubbings of his presidential campaign losing badly in five states falling further behind donald trump and watching his dim hopes of capturing the republican nomination fade further yet less than hours later the senator from texas did something normally reserved for presumptive nominees rather than struggling underdogs he announced a vice presidential running mate in choosing carly fiorina for that spot here wednesday cruz reached for a political lifeline at a time when he is running out of them facing a must win situation against trump in next tuesdayâ s indiana primary cruz is trying one unâ orâ thoâ dox maneuver after another in hopes of extending the race and forcing a contested republican convention in cleveland â his only hope for becoming the nominee the announcement was designed in part to sharpen the contrast with trump that cruz is trying to draw introducing fiorina at an afternoon rally in downtown indianapolis cruz highlighted the former hewlett packard chief executiveâ s fierce exchanges with trump and her refusal to back down from him when she was a candidate the atlantic nora kellyjust like that carly fiorina is back the former hp executive dropped out of the presidential race months ago after a poor showing in new hampshire but now that ted cruz has tapped her as his running mate fiorina can exert influence over the race once again and potentially try to make up for qualities cruz lacks â we must unite â the texas senator said referring to the republican party â and carly is a vice presidential nominee who i believe is supremely skilled supremely gifted at helping unite this party â cruzâ s announcement was well timed in terms of attracting attention to his campaign it came one day after trump swept the northeast and hours after cruzâ s chief rival made his first poorly reviewed policy speech it also comes days before the primary in indiana where cruz hopes to slow trumpâ s accumulation of delegates now with fiorina by his side washington post peter w stevensonit felt like the longest introduction ever maybe because everyone knew what was coming â or maybe because it just felt like ted cruz was stalling for time â but cruz s announcement that carly fiorina will be his running mate and vice presidential pick at least for the rest of the nomination process really did feel like it might not ever end viewers really wanted one thing to see carly fiorina walk out on stage with cruz shake his hand and maybe stand there while confetti or balloons fell from the ceiling standard political stuff with a little rah rah patriotism thrown in because you know messaging but they had to wait perhaps cruz rightly it turned out thought that an extended introduction would get him more television time perhaps the new cruz fiorina sign that was placed on the podium when fiorina finally walked out still had some wet paint that needed to dry or perhaps cruz just really wanted to say a lot about his new running mate and i mean a lot wall street journal janet hookfor months as ohio gov john kasich trailed in the gop presidential race his aides and supporters said his moment would come when the campaign moved into the more moderate northeast the five states that voted tuesday were thought to harbor large pockets of voters drawn to mr kasichâ s strain of solutions oriented conservatism but gop voters in connecticut delaware maryland pennsylvania and rhode island instead sided overwhelmingly with frontrunner donald trump the results werenâ t just bad news for mr kasichâ s struggling presidential campaign they marked a turning point for a fading brand of republicanism a recent kasich strategy memo singled out congressional districts in maryland and connecticut where he hoped to beat mr trump in maryland â our data show that trump could lose to kasich in almost any districtâ but one on the stateâ s eastern shore the memo said instead mr trump didnâ t just win every county in all five states he won all but two counties by double digits politico ben schreckingerdonald trump kept uncharacteristically quiet about carly fiorina in his first campaign stop since ted cruz announced the former hewlett packard ceo as his running mate on wednesday the republican front runner mocked the texas senatorâ s decision to make a vice presidential pick at an evening rally in indianapolis but did not comment on fiorina herself leaving the attacks to advisers stephen miller and paul manafort the businessman has worked to avoid alienating female voters â recently backing down from a statement that if abortion is outlawed women who undergo the procedure should be punished and granting an upcoming interview to fox news anchor megyn kelly after several months of personal attacks one of his few damaging debate exchanges came with fiorina over comments criticizing her looks making attacks on her risky campaigning ahead of indianaâ s critical tuesday primary trump gave fiorina a free pass instead going after cruz for picking a running mate at all â first of all you have to look cruz canâ t win whatâ s he doing picking vice presidents â trump said comparing cruz to a baseball team that had already lost the world series â he is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country whoâ s mathematically eliminated from being president who chose a vice presidential candidate â trumpâ s advisers were less reserved seizing on fiorinaâ s record of outsourcing american jobs as the chief executive of tech giant hewlett packard a line of attack that helped seal her defeat in her california senate challenge to democratic incumbent barbara boxer politico jacob heilbrunnever since the news broke that the magazine i edit the national interest would host donald trump for a big foreign policy speech at the mayflower hotel in washington iâ ve been fielding calls from think tank friends not to mention places like the daily beast and the washington post where friends and acquaintances asked what was really behind the event was i joining the trump brigade was zalmay khalilzad the former u s ambassador to the united nations whom we picked to moderate the event a covert trump supporter not a chance with his impeccable establishment credentialsâ a trifecta of ambassadorships to afghanistan iraq and the u n â khalilzad seemed like the perfect candidate to lend the event some gravitas his introduction of trump was about as neutral as could be the most he was willing to grant is that trump is a â provocative voiceâ with â distinctive views about americaâ s purpose and mission abroad â still in one sense the questions were understandable the prospect of a publication like oursâ one identified with the â realistâ school of foreign policy which advocates balance of power geopolitics and caution abroadâ hosting trump offers an irresistible line of inquiry for anyone searching for what looks like a phantom trump foreign policy team politico michael crowleyin his address to an elite invitation only washington foreign policy audience wednesday donald trump promised that as president he would restore a coherent vision to america s role in the world but across the ideological spectrum and even among natural allies trump s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that trump is up to the job it struck me as a very odd mishmash said doug bandow a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian cato institute who shares many of trump s beliefs about scaling back america s role abroad he called for a new foreign policy strategy but you don t really get the sense he gave one trump s speech was lacking in policy prescriptions and its strident rhetoric masked a lack of depth said robert bud mcfarlane a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan who attended the speech speaking at washington s mayflower hotel trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign including promises to cut better trade deals with china swiftly defeat the islamic state rebuild the military and reduce the expense america incurs in upholding international security from europe to asia trump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies he also unveiled a new theme saying that the u s would finally have a coherent foreign policy based on narrow self interest economic gain and global stability politico nick gassthe leaders of three prominent liberal and pro abortion rights organizations on thursday issued a scathing letter to ted cruz urging the texas senator to oust troy newman co chair of the pro lifers for cruz coalition citing his past incendiary statements and comments on abortion â while there are a number of coalition members whose records raise serious concerns troy newmanâ s history of violent rhetoric and harassment toward womenâ s health providers is truly beyond the pale â wrote ilyse hogue president of naral pro choice america michael keegan president of people for the american way and dawn laguens executive vice president of planned parenthood action fund the letter comes a day after cruz announced that he would put carly fiorina on his presidential ticket if he becomes the republican nominee fiorina has been outspoken against planned parenthood pushing for ending the group s federal funding after a series of videos surfaced that purported to show planned parenthood makes a profit from the tissue of aborted fetuses a claim the organization has firmly denied newman is a founding board member of the center for medical progress the group that produced the videos new york times alan rappeportthe â stop trumpâ movement is getting a new look as senator ted cruz of texas has taken the highly unusual step of picking an early running mate as he looks to block donald j trump from winning the republican nomination mr cruz and his vice presidential hopeful carly fiorina will hit the campaign trail and make three stops together in indiana creating a spectacle so rare for this stage of an election that it could steal some of the spotlight that tends to shine brightest on mr trump but will mrs fiorina matter perhaps at a time when mr trump has injected gender politics into the campaign by accusing hillary clinton of playing the â womanâ s card â mr cruz his leading republican rival has joined forces with someone who highlights mr trumpâ s weakness with female voters and relishes skewering him she also offers voters a preview of what a diverse republican general

joining the cruzcrew as ted cruzâ s running mate on the republican ticket â if â and this is a yuuuge if â he can overtake donald trump for the partyâ s presidential nomination wednesday s announcement in indianapolis came a day after trump crushed cruz in a sweep of primaries and triggered epic twitter fits over his reference to hillary clinton s woman s card now cruz trails him by nearly delegates and indiana s may primary is possibly his last chance to keep trump from winning the nomination outright can fiorina help him win maybe if she doesn t sing the new york times the editorial boardafter landslide republican primary victories donald trump delivered a speech on wednesday in washington intended to clarify his foreign policy positions that was needed because his views on americaâ s role in the world have until now been expressed in tweets interviews and remarks at rallies that have alarmed nearly every foreign ally of the united states no oneâ s fears are likely to be allayed by this speech which was clearly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter it did not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world understanding of the balance or exercise of power or even a careful reading of history when one has a hammer everything looks like a nail and when oneâ s experience is limited to real estate deals everything looks like a lease negotiation hearing mr trump describe his approach to foreign relations one imagines a group of nations sitting at a table with him at its head rather like a scene from â the apprentice â with him demanding more money more troops and policy changes in exchange for american protection trade and friendship and if he doesnâ t get what he wants â in negotiation you must be willing to walk â mr trump said the wall street journalas donald trump closes in on the republican nomination heâ s rolling out a formal lecture series to detail his agenda and burnish a more dignified brand his maiden policy speech on wednesday devoted to foreign affairs earns an â incompleteâ at trump university â america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration â mr trump said in washington he called for â a new foreign policy direction for our countryâ one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peace â the businessman didnâ t mention if the same principle will apply to his rallies or harum scarum campaign the word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards if not his own the central motif like all of mr trumpâ s political thought is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given problem and everybody else is a pathetic loser so trust his instincts and temperament â iâ m the only oneâ believe me i know them allâ iâ m the only one who knows how to fix it â he said washington post editorial boardrep donna edwards who lost marylandâ s democratic primary for u s senate on tuesday to rep chris van

washington post editorial boardwith sweeping wins in five east coast states tuesday donald trump socked the forces within the republican party that have vowed never to support him picking up more than pledged delegates he brought himself closer to clinching the gop nomination on the first ballot at julyâ s republican national convention before most of the gains sen ted cruz tex has made in the partyâ s arcane delegate selection process could come into play these facts in hand mr trump declared himself the presumptive gop nominee if mr trump were anything like a typical candidate

people support the democratic party they give a lot of reasons why when you gave xx on date to the dnc it might have been because you alt for nds when folks like you give to the dnc it s often because you want to protect the progress that we ve made over the past seven years or it s because you don t want to see million people lose the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care coverage and because you don t want to see declining graduation rates for our young people and you don t want to see the unprecedented job growth we ve experienced over the past months reversed the xx donations you ve made in this election alt for nds the donations grassroots supporters have made in this election prove just how committed you are to moving this country forward and we can t thank you enough for that every single day folks like you are laying the foundation for some critical wins in november in important races all across the country not just the presidential race we re poised to replace governors and senators who are living in the past with democrats whose vision for the future of this country means actually moving this country into the future so right now i m coming to you again because we need you name we need you to dig deep and pitch in again before our monthly deadline saturday at midnight can i count on you to pitch in or whatever you can to make sure our

fortunate this election cycle name we have two terrific presidential candidates in hillary clinton and bernie sanders making us proud with smart substantive debates and focusing on the issues that really matter it s a world of difference from the pettiness and name calling we ve seen on the other side and because republican senators so often refuse to do their jobs we ve got a map that s in our favor and a good chance to take back our majority this is all good news but unfortunately republican in fighting hasn t distracted them from their desire to beat us and i know that because it s my job to look at the numbers and so far the gop has raised more than million to beat us that s a lot of money name and i ll be honest it s more than we ve raised but here s a bit more good news there s still time to build the kind of foundation we need to win in november we just need grassroots supporters like you to step up and help us cross that finish line can i count on you to pitch in or more before this next end of month deadline linksthanks so much with the help of supporters like you i know we re going to knock this one out of the park bradbrad marshallchief financial officerdemocratic national committee v jgr friend i m going to be very straightforward with you name we haven t raised as much money as our counterparts on the republican side we re coming up short according to their

more you with grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like or bucks we re slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure that democrats all across the country are going to benefit from come november we re laying the foundation for serious wins and we need to keep going every time someone like you decides to click that donate button and give whatever you can it s another voice telling the rnc and the millionaires and billionaires who are backing them that they can t buy this election we ve got the right candidates and we re fighting on the right side of history now we ve just got to see it through til november th so name i m asking you to be one of those voices right now push this button and pitch in or whatever you can to support democrats up and down the ticket

republicans on tuesday whether they would support using a fast track measure to approve a mental health reform bill that s been idle since it was approved by the senate help committee in march politico first learned the decision to hotline the bill signals that senate leadership might want to move the legislation soon despite remaining struggles over funding and gun politics the move comes as leaders are trying to approve appropriations bills if those don t move or get delayed this could be an alternative to fill floor time gun fight looming sen john cornyn the senate s no republican almost immediately submitted his own mental health reform bill as an amendment to the help measure being fast tracked although the majority of cornyn s measure contains bipartisan provisions dealing with the law enforcement it also includes language dealing with gun background checks that is a nonstarter for democrats who want to keep the issues separate that provision alone threatens to sink the effort separately sens chris murphy and bill cassidy announced they will hold a senate mental health summit on may to continue pushing their bill trump i ll appoint judges who could overturn roe v wade the republican front runner defended his anti abortion stance and vowed to protect life in a fox news interview on tuesday the biggest way you can protect it is through the supreme court and putting people on the court donald trump told host bill o reilly actually the biggest way you can protect it i guess is by electing me president but trump hedged a bit when directly asked if he would

treatment advocates aren t pleased the e amp c bill would have raised the number of patients doctors can treat with buprenorphine from to a measure badly needed to fill the treatment gap between those addicted to opioids and those who have access to care advocates say that was scrapped after the cbo said it would be costly according to lobbyists now the bill instead includes a sense of the house recommendation that the hhs secretary consider raising the cap which doesn t cost anything but it doesn t do anything either w e are deeply concerned that the bill will not raise the patient caps and

for ryan mcconnell in wild a timely story per last night s knockout alexander bolton and scott wong for the hill mitch mcconnell and paul ryan have adopted strikingly different approaches to leading their party in a turbulent election year dominated by donald trump the result is a republican party as rudderless as it has been in decades ryan the house speaker is pushing an ambitious agenda he

"2016-05-04 00:02","DNC Talking Points: Cruz Out, Trump is the GOP","MirandaL@dnc.org","MirandaL@dnc.org"," dnc talking pointscruz out trump is the gopmay topline message the results of the primaries in indiana are the culmination of a disastrous week for the republican party with ted cruz s capitulation the gop s problems now extend far beyond their convention donald trump simply doesn t have the judgment or temperament to be president and the american people know it ted cruz may have been the least liked politician in washington but trump is one of the least liked men in america and democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive rhetoric dangerous ideas and lack of judgment every single day between today and november th in indiana like in other primaries over the past few weeks the vast majority of democratic primary voters said our primary had energized them and majorities would support either one of our strong candidates a majority of republicans on the other hand conceded that their primary has been divisive and said they feel betrayed by the republican party the next president of the united states will be nominated at our democratic convention in philadelphia republicans had their worst week ever in just seven days republicans saw their former house speaker call one of their candidates lucifer in the flesh watched a desperate mathematically eliminated campaign announce a vice presidential pick and get ridiculed for it and then kicked off the indiana primaries with accusations that ted cruz s father was tied to lee harvey oswald that last allegation was made by dangerous donald trump based on a tabloid story he saw in the national enquirer now the gop is stuck with the tabloid touting reality tv star as their presumptive nominee a divisive candidate whose ugly campaign rhetoric is tied to dangerous proposals that would drag america backwards and make our country less safe more than out of democrats are energized by our primary last week in connecticut and pennsylvania respectively and of democrats reported feeling energized by our primary today in indiana it was three quarters of democratic voters who said our primary has energized our party and a majority of democrats who voted today expressed support for either one of our candidates in indiana exit polls showed that percent of republican primary voters say they feel betrayed by the republican party a majority of republicans concede that their primary has been divisive and easily a third of republicans would prefer to stay home or support an alternative candidate than vote for trump in november and the republican party is less popular than it s been in more than two decades a crisis of their own making for years gop leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants minorities the poor the lgbt community and more all for political gain they have sold hardworking americans the empty promise of trickle down prosperity while strangling america s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top donald trump s impending nomination after tuesday s results is the ultimate sad culmination of the success of that strategy trump is the modern republican party trump s republican opponents didn t stand up to him because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party they didn t want to alienate them democrats won t hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the american people who share our values of inclusion hard work dignity and opportunity for all and we ll hold republicans on the ballot at every level accountable for their standard bearer the republican establishment is having trouble coming to terms with their nominee and even some of them are acknowledging trump is dangerous and lacks the judgment to be commander in chief o former secretary of defense robert gates on sunday said that he s troubled by the fact that donald trump doesn t listen to anyone and raised serious questions about trump on foreign policy between his contradictions and threatening our most important alliances donald trump would put our country on a dangerous path democrats will be united democrats will emerge united from our primary and our convention both hillary clinton and bernie sanders have been clear they ll work hard in november to ensure we don t let a republican like trump drag our country backward while we recognize that any campaign will see the intensity level rise down the stretch we expect our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election hillary clinton and bernie sanders have drawn sharp differences with one another but overwhelmingly they ve been focused on substance and how to best move america forward because the party s platform is a statement of our values the dnc is committed to an open inclusive and representative process both of our campaigns will be represented on the platform drafting committee and just as we did in and the public will have opportunities to participate democrats know that we re stronger when more voices are heard and when we stand together to move our country forward we ll see that in philadelphia at our convention dangerous donald trump is reckless lacks the temperament and judgment to serve on abortion trump has taken multiple positions on abortion from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion to saying he would allow states to restrict women s rights to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments the gop s problem with women voters all of the republican candidates have made it clear that the gop doesn t stand with women donald trump is viewed unfavorably by out of women after an ugly primary in which he has regularly made offensive comments and shown a deep disrespect for women john kasich said that he wants to see roe v wade repealed and when asked what kind of punishment that would lead to he evaded the question by saying that it should be left to the states ted cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term in the past the republican candidates have opposed ensuring equal pay family leave and voted against the violence against women act last month we marked equal pay day the day in when women s earnings have caught up with men s earnings from on average women earn cents to their dollar and it s worse for women of color all of the republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace john kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don t need workplace protections just a change of heart among major employers ted cruz voted against the paycheck fairness act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a show vote donald trump stated that women would have pay equity if they did as good a job as men advantage democrats democrats are winning where it matters hillary clinton has earned more votes well over million and far ahead of donald trump while bernie sanders has earned more than million votes well ahead of ted cruz and john kasich while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors if there is an enthusiasm gap it clearly favors democrats democratic national committee"

says obama will pay respect to atomic bombing victims good tuesday morning it s days to cleveland days to philly days to election behind the curtain republican insiders are buzzing about sen bob corker r tenn chair of senate foreign relations as an attractive plausible vice presidential pick for trump corker age to trump s surprised many in washington by lavishing on camera praise on trump s foreign policy speech two weeks ago last week corker told usa today s mary troyan who covers tennessee for gannett that he offered to help donald trump develop a foreign policy platform making him one of the few senators to publicly embrace trump trump called him last week and he and trump s campaign staff have talked since then corker among the wealthiest members of congress spent most of his life in business and his bio says he brings a results driven businessman s perspective a republican who knows corker well said he s an independent guy kind of a tough guy who s not afraid to swim upstream he s frustrated by being in the senate and not getting anything done i think he d really lean into this he s not afraid to buck the old guard and he s no dummy he jumped out on the trump thing early another great mentioner told us corker is not well liked by his colleagues in the senate a big reason is he likes to get stuff done with democrats trump might find that attractive trump who has said he plans to pick an experienced politician who knows the hill and can help him get things done dropped a potentially significant clue in his march interview with the washpost s bob woodward and bob costa somebody that can walk into the senate and who s been friendly with these guys for years and people for years who s a current officeholder who has served in both house and senate and first came

for then was george w bush s ambassador to germany arriving just before coats promoted faith based initiatives on the outside then in returned to the senate where he s on finance and intelligence of course trump has a special place in his heart for the hoosier state and a longtime friend said of coats he s beloved the man has no enemies everyone loves him he s a governing choice clean as a whistle sen john thune r s d who gets mentioned around town as a v p said in march that he d support the nominee thune reiterated that support last week in an interview with ksfy the abc station in sioux falls but said he hopes trump will mature as a candidate i think there are a lot of things in terms of what he s said and how he s said them that he s going to have to demonstrate that he can improve upon and that he can be a candidate that actually is true to republican principles i m hopeful over time and we ll see in the weeks and months ahead that donald trump can become that kind of person one that seems more likely indiana gov mike pence hoosier theme who s a favorite of the kochs and served years in the u s house with a stint as chair of the house republican conference pence

durkin called it deplorable that hastert lied to the fbi during an initial investigation that ultimately led to a felony charge that hastert broke federal law on reporting cash transactions while paying hush money to a former student at a school where he was a coach durkin also said it was unconscionable that hastert initially accused the former student known in the case as individual a of extortion leading the fbi to begin investigating the victim trump who it sure looks like donald trump is going to be the gop nominee this year forever altering the fortunes of the congressional gop s

saw this memo from this weekend from the co chairs of the dnc rules and bylaws committee with an update with where we are and how our process works macintosh hd users meenayi documents departments digital misc letterhead templates circle d blue png to interested partiesfrom lorraine miller and jim roosevelt jr co chairs of the dnc rules and bylaws committeeregarding an overview of the democratic delegate selection processdate april cycle overviewdemocrats are excited about the democratic primary election season and that s because we have strong candidates who are dedicated to solving the issues that matter most to americans voters are eager to cast their vote for the next democratic presidential nominee and participate in the democratic delegate selection process in their state our process aims to uphold our party s values of inclusivity diversity and transparency here is the democratic delegate selection process by the numbers total number of democratic delegates as of today total number of pledged democratic delegates total number of unpledged delegates number of delegate votes needed to win the democratic nomination as of today the number of presidential nominating contestsprocess developmentthe dnc rules and bylaws committee rbc reviews the delegate selection rules prior to each presidential election year while the general structure of the democratic delegate selection process has been in place since the committee over the course of many public meetings reflects on the delegate selection process of the previous cycle and updates the rules accordingly the rbc met five times in in order to finalize the delegate selection rules for the cycle which were then shared with the state and territory democratic parties in may of each party submitted their delegate selection plan to the rbc these plans were subsequently reviewed by the committee to ensure compliance with the dnc s delegate selection rules during the summer of at three public meetings attended by press presidential campaigns and other interested parties held on june july and august in partnership with the rbc dnc staff and presidential campaigns state parties work to implement their delegate selection plans starting in september of until the process draws to a close while state and territory parties are the drivers of their process the creation and implementation of their plans are governed by the dnc s delegate selection rules the call for the convention and the regulations of the rules and bylaws committee these materials provide states and territories with the guidance that ensures fundamental values of the democratic party such as a commitment to diversity and participation of all eligible voters are upheld throughout this process for example each state and territory party solicits public comment on their plan for no less than days to allow for input from constituents making the drafting of the delegate selection plan a democratic process additionally each state is required to develop and implement an extensive affirmative action and inclusion outreach plan the state and territory parties as well as presidential campaigns are tasked with conducting widespread outreach and recruitment to encourage democrats of all backgrounds to run to be delegates our party believes that our convention should look like america and state and territory parties and campaigns are responsible for striving to meet that diversity goal the republican delegate selection process versus the democratic processsome stark differences between the democrats delegate selection process and the republican s delegate selection process were mentioned in the previous section but that s not where the differences end outlined below are some major differences between our process and that of the republicans a commitment to diversity and equal representation of men and women the solicitation of input from the public during the creation of a state s delegate selection plan the transparent development of our rules proportional allocation of pledged delegates to presidential candidates based on the results of the state s primary or caucuso unlike the republicans we do not allow for winner take all outcomes meaning that the candidate who wins the majority vote in a state does not win all of the state s delegates o instead presidential candidates who break threshold which is in all states are allocated delegates proportional to the percentage of the vote that they won in the primary or caucus o delegates must affirm in writing that they are bona fide supporters of the candidates that they are representing in the delegation and are subject to review by each campaign o we believe that this is the fairest way to reflect the intention of democratic voters and to mirror the results at each step in the delegate selection process in the states delegates elected in the states are pledged not bound meaning that they are required only to represent in good faith those who elected them unpledged delegatesan often discussed feature of the democratic delegate selection process is the unpledged delegates also referred to as superdelegates these individuals serve by virtue of the elected office that they hold and they include democratic governors democratic members of congress distinguished party leaders such as former presidents and former leaders in the senate and the house dnc memberswe ensure these leaders have a voice in our convention and their existence as a separate group means that interested voters don t have to run against elected officials in order to attend the democratic national convention unpledged delegates are also distinguished by the fact that they are not pledged to a presidential candidate based on the results of their state s primary or caucus and instead exercise their best judgment when selecting a presidential candidate to support concerns that unpledged delegates may change the outcome of the election are historically unfounded unpledged delegates have never changed the outcome of an election since unpledged delegates were established over years ago like pledged delegates unpledged delegate cast one vote which carries the same weight as the vote of any other delegate there have been recent reports of harassment or mistreatment of state parties who are managing the process in their state and unpledged delegates this does not reflect the values of this process and our great party state parties are working year round to elect democrats at every level and are the foundation of our party unpledged delegates have been a feature of our process for many decades and will continue to play a role we encourage all interested parties including presidential candidates and members of the press and public to learn all about their state s process it is important that our process is open transparent and maximizes participation each state plan has undergone a rigorous review process to ensure compliance with our rules and changing rules midway through the cycle would lead to confusion among participants in the delegate selection process unnecessary costs to state parties and inconsistent standards for states to abide by our party spends years preparing for each presidential election cycle and we believe that our process is designed to best position our party and our eventual nominee for victory in the general election in november we are looking forward to the democratic national convention in july where our delegates will cast their vote for the next president of the united states democratic national committee"

democratic party they give a lot of reasons why when you gave xx on date to the dnc it might have been because you alt for nds when folks like you give to the dnc itâ s often because you want to protect the progress that weâ ve made over the past seven years or it s because you donâ t want to see million people lose the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care coverage and because you donâ t want to see declining graduation rates for our young people and you donâ t want to see the unprecedented job growth weâ ve experienced over the past months reversed the xx donations youâ ve made in this election alt for nds the donations grassroots supporters have made in this election prove just how committed you are to moving this country forward and we canâ t thank you enough for that every single day folks like you are laying the foundation for some critical wins in november in important races all across the country not just the presidential race weâ re poised to replace governors and senators who are living in the past with democrats whose vision for the future of this country means actually moving this country into the future so right now iâ m coming to you again because we

cycle name we have two terrific presidential candidates in hillary clinton and bernie sanders making us proud with smart substantive debates and focusing on the issues that really matter itâ s a world of difference from the pettiness and name calling we ve seen on the other side and because republican senators so often refuse to do their jobs weâ ve got a map thatâ s in our favor and a good chance to take back our majority this is all good news but unfortunately republican in fighting hasnâ t distracted them from their desire to beat us â and i know that because itâ s my job to look at the numbers and so far the gop has raised more than million to beat us thatâ s a lot of money name and iâ ll be honest â itâ s more than weâ ve raised but here s a bit more good news thereâ s still time

lippman dlippman dlippman politico com good wednesday morning sneak peek ivanka trump to norah o donnell on cbs this morning re the n y times article about her father and women i m not in every interaction my father has but he s not a groper it s not who he is and i ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women he was promoting women in development and construction at a time when it was unheard of there was no trend towards equality in the real estate and construction industry back in the s and he was doing it because he believes ultimately in merit coming attractions members of the conservative intelligentsia aching for a republican to run independent against trump have concluded that there is a difficult but viable path for an independent based largely on the unusual unpopularity of the two nominees a well known conservative told us the final three possibilities are sen ben sasse age of nebraska sen tom coburn of wyoming and mitt romney this conservative told us to expect renewed buzz around this possibility over the next week and sees a chance that one of the three will do it trump strategery bucking trends trump sends teams to democrat leaning states by ap s steve peoples with julie bykowicz jill colvin and julie pace trump is rushing to install operatives in several states that traditionally favor democrats pointing to a general election plan consistent with the campaign he has run thus far defying conventional wisdom and political trends the staffing expansion includes maine minnesota and other places where trump opens as the underdog with the new york billionaire seeking to expand the electoral battlefield by drawing on his appeal among working class white voters i t is an unlikely path to the white house through states that no republican presidential candidate has carried since the s the trump campaign has identified roughly states where it plans to install state directors by the end of the month they include traditional battlegrounds like ohio florida and virginia and more challenging terrain such as minnesota michigan wisconsin pennsylvania and maine places republican have lost for the last six presidential elections or longer target states also will likely include republican leaning georgia where demographic shifts benefit democrats sweating the bern with of the vote in all but of precincts ap left kentucky s democratic presidential primary too close to call the tight margin means that the two will split the state s delegates fairly evenly clinton has to sanders that s votes to a landslide margin of out of cast martin o malley got among other randos sanders won oregon by points after clinton and sanders traded leads through the evening kentucky secretary of state alison lundergan grimes a clinton supporter told cnn she was the unofficial winner paul begala said on cnn that the victory was tighter than a speedo on chris christie hillaryclinton celebrated by twice tweeting a donation link we just won kentucky thanks to everyone who turned out we re always stronger united hillary just won kentucky but this election is just getting started chip in now if you ve got her back pulling back the camera clinton s joyless victory her narrow kentucky win is a temporary comfort in a week that exposed a deep democratic rift by gabe debenedetti clinton s narrow kentucky win her lone state victory in the month of may and one that ensured she wouldn t go five weeks without winning a state was paired with a loss in oregon during a week when sanders supporters appeared more emboldened and committed than ever despite the senator s all but impossible path to the nomination but but but one of our favorite oregon democrats writes from out west gas coming out of the bernie balloon oregon built to feel the bern and he was all over and spent a ton here pts doesn t feel like much of a win there s a sense that maybe bernie is getting out of his depth time for him to get on board and stop helping trump trash her robert draper on the cover of the upcoming sunday s n y times magazine mr trump s wild ride down the homestretch with the impossible nominee on the more conventional presidential campaigns i have covered the candidate s mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity the advisers hovering constantly over their boss on trump s plane the aides spoke when spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on their laptops f or all his swagger trump was compulsively superstitious twice on other plane trips i had seen him toss a few granules of salt over his left shoulder after eating i asked trump if he had ever been to iraq never he said sounding horrified by the thought what s the most dangerous place in the world you ve been to he contemplated this for a second brooklyn he said laughing no he went on there are places in america that are among the most dangerous in the world you go to places like oakland or ferguson the crime numbers are worse seriously it was a stark reminder of what set trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position how little of the world he had seen beyond the archipelago of boardrooms golf courses and high rise hotels he inhabited in his briefcase corey lewandowski carried a bulky black binder it contained virtually everything of significance in trump s political universe the daily weekly and monthly master schedules the full staff list with everyone s contact information a similar list of the campaign s various contractors daily talking points for staff and surrogates a running tally of the delegate count a list of trump endorsers a metrics chart of field activities in each state including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked

the hostile view he held over much of the past year in fact it was murdoch himself who directed kelly to hammer trump during the debut gop debate in cleveland that sparked the feud in the first place rupert told her to do that said a source the murdoch trump alliance is the result of at least two private meetings between the billionaires this spring as well as phone calls from trump s son in law

percent support while trump garners percent support the numbers come as trump s main rival sen ted cruz dropped out of the race virtually clearing the way for trump to clinch the nomination clinton s delegate lead over rival sen bernie sanders is also nearly insurmountable despite her loss in indiana tuesday bernie sanderssen bernie sanders said his point win in indiana s democratic presidential primary on tuesday will help him pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states sanders acknowledged that his path to the nomination is narrow but pledged to fight for every vote he called on clinton to debate him in delegate rich california where he said he will hold large rallies ahead of the state s primary in june sanders said he has enough money to fund a winning campaign for the remaining contests one problem for sanders though is that only four of the remaining democratic nominating contests are open or semi open to independents who largely favor sanders in indiana s primary which also was open of independent voters surveyed in a cnn exit poll said they supported sanders republican party candidatested cruzit seems strange to say this about the man who until last night was one of the last three people standing in a republican presidential primary that has come to resemble a cross between rollerball and insult night at the local chuckle hut but ted cruz was always a terrible candidate for the gop nomination over the past couple of weeks cruz s ineptness has already become crystal clear as his campaign has imploded he has flailed harder and harder in search of some game changing moment to keep him going he made noise about a contested convention and worked hard to plant his loyalists among the state delegations that will vote for the nominee in cleveland even as voters were telling him they hate that idea he selected carly fiorina as a vice presidential running mate a move so desperate it s a wonder that every tv in america didn t start leaking flop sweat whenever images of the two together appeared on their screens john kasichohio gov john kasich has cancelled a planned event to make a wednesday night statement in ohio nbc reported kasich was left the only man standing against donald trump in the republican presidential primary race after sen ted cruz of texas suspended his run on tuesday night trump won a resounding victory on tuesday night in indiana taking all of the state s gop delegates according to nbc in response cruz suspended his run concluding that he had there was no longer a viable path to his becoming the republican standard bearer in the general election donald trumpwill donald trump ever be presidential in the conventional manner we have come to expect it s a path he may never follow but after his victory in indiana on tuesday night and ted cruz s decision to suspend his campaign there is now rampant speculation as to what presidential will mean should trump s executive desk move to the oval office as with any presidential nominee the selection of their vice presidential running mate is important because it offers us a window into their thinking trump recently gave some insight into his thoughts on the matter when he told neil cavuto on the fox business network i would want to choose a politician i m a businessman i don t think we need two guys like me here are four individuals

"2016-04-26 18:41","***UPDATED: DNC Primary Day Talking Points","MirandaL@dnc.org","MirandaL@dnc.org"," friends please discard the last set and use this one thanks primary day talking pointstopline message today as millions of americans in five states go to the polls democrats are voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most republicans are holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike least we expect that today we ll see the same thing we ve seen throughout this campaign our voters are energized with the serious and substantive primary we ve had and two candidates who both have the judgment and temperament to serve while republican voters will continue to be dismayed with the chaos on their side in the last primary in new york exit polls showed that nearly out of every democratic voters believe that our primary has energized our party that s because our two candidates have consistently offered strong well thought out visions for our country that would move america forward that s consistent with wisconsin where out of democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our candidates that s something we re not seeing on the republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues not to mention their judgment and temperament given how ugly divisive and insulting they ve been their own voters know it just of republicans in new york thought their campaign has energized their party in wisconsin out of republican primary voters let me say that again republican primary voters said they fear what a trump presidency would do to our country and roughly a third would rather stay home vote for a third party or vote for a democrat than support either trump or cruz that s stunning but it tells you that democrats are heading into november in a far stronger position than republicans talking pointschaos in cleveland vs our next president in philadelphiawe re less than days from the july conventions and it s clear that democrats will emerge united while republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency both hillary clinton and bernie sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual democratic nominee just yesterday senator sanders said at a town hall on msnbc that he will do everything in his power to make sure no republican gets into the white house in november and secretary clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we ve made under democratic leadership over the last years because the party s platform is a statement of our values the dnc is committed to an open inclusive and representative process both of our campaigns will be represented on the platform drafting committee and just as we did in and the public will have opportunities to participate democrats know that we re stronger when more voices are heard and when we stand together to move our country forward we ll see that in philadelphia at our convention we ll see our next president on our stage at the democratic convention in philadelphia compare that to the republicans this week the increasingly desperate cruz and kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop trump but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was happening one third of trump supporters said they would abandon the republican party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third party candidate even republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive convention you ve already seen republican candidates in tight races like senator kirk in illinois and john mccain the gop nominee eight years ago say they will not attend their own convention in cleveland but don t let them fool you they re not any better than the top of their ticket joint fundraising committees we welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the dnc and state parties which is why we stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the clinton campaign and the sanders campaign early in the cycle the dnc is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect democrats up and down the ballot in november it s important to note the funds that the dnc and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen for example our national voter file and communications research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates that includes training across a variety of areas for example and access to media monitoring and rapid response support this is helping us build infrastructure for the general election these arrangements are not new or unusual similar joint fundraising committees were established with our democratic candidate in both and and again both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds and let s be clear neither the dnc nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign for whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising united convention arizona lawsuit we re going to be united at our convention and we re confident in our process which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates we ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise ultimately secretary clinton and senator sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another but their differences remain focused on how to best move america forward o they re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the american people that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive and that we respect everyone in america if you want to talk about a rigged process let s focus on the real problem we re seeing across the country the democratic national committee and the democratic senatorial campaign committee are suing officials in arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their march primaries and many to be disenfranchised as a result we want to make sure that doesn t happen in november if you want to talk about rigging elections that s the real example and it s a serious problem and we re glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the american people to vote in maricopa county officials reduced the number of polling locations to just for every people that s seven times what it was in other parts of the state and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that republicans are championing all across the country and it s not just arizona you had a member of congress from wisconsin glenn grothman who flat out said that they expected they could now win wisconsin because of the voter id law it was his kevin mccarthy moment and the type of rigging of the system we re not going to put up with when voters go to the polls in november they can be certain that the democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief and that s not something you can say about the republican candidates gop frontrunner trump is reckless and dangerous on abortion trump has taken multiple positions on abortion from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion to saying he would allow states to restrict women s rights to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments cruz the vast majority of his republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him lindsey graham crassly talked about how no one in the senate would object if he was killed on the senate floor and said that endorsing him over trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot senator jim risch of idaho twice gave one of the most passive non endorsement endorsements i ve ever seen it s going to be very difficult for senators and congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don t like the gop s problem with women voterstrump is viewed unfavorably by out of women but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term in the past the republican candidates have opposed equal pay family leave and voted against the violence against women act earlier this month we marked equal pay day the day in when women s earnings have caught up with men s earnings from on average we earn cents to their dollar and it s worse for women of color all of the republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace john kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don t need workplace protections just a change of heart among major employers ted cruz voted against the paycheck fairness act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a show vote donald trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did as good a job as men republicans to blame for trump and his down ballot impactit s fitting that donald trump is the standard bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long since they ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security they ve given birthers like trump a pass and fueled the tea party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy then while in office the only thing republicans have done in washington over the last seven years is obstruct trump is the republican party advantage democratsdespite all the media attention that republican frontrunner trump gets with his say anything strategy democrats are winning where it matters senator clinton has earned more than million votes over a million more than donald trump while senator sanders has earned more than million votes well ahead of ted cruz and john kasich while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors if there is an enthusiasm gap it clearly favors democrats democrats will have the strongest candidate in november period and we are poised to take back the senate and make serious gains in the house broad contrast and infrastructure we have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the republicans nominate we see the numbers of course it s clear trump is far ahead of his competitors and we re ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention but we don t think taking on trump is fundamentally different from any of the others at least with trump he s not shy about exposing what the republican brand has truly become ted cruz and john kasich are every bit as extreme as their party s front runner they just hide it a bit better they promise the same extreme agenda on women s rights they deny the threat of climate change and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship they all want to drag america back to the failed economic policies of the last republican president who left office losing jobs a month and having plunged our country into the great recession and they ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric using language that alienates our allies helps isis recruit terrorists and makes america less safe so if it is trump we re ready maybe it s cruz but it s hard to see how that comes together in the end but regardless we re building a ground game and an infrastructure that s ready to challenge him on every single position he s taking on the campaign trail and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the american people democratic national committee"

on time in the fall developments an education funding overhaul bill hit a road bump after the illinois state board of education released numbers showing district by district impact of the proposed

called fair tax push that was supposed to transform how the state taxes individuals hit a brick wall that means it missed the deadline to send it to the senate in time to make it onto this fall s

garcia manar sought to tamp down opposition by including a so called hold harmless provision that would ensure no school district would receive less money during the first year of his plan those cuts would instead be phased in over four years manar accused rauner of deliberately derailing a vote on his bill saying state education officials have had his proposal since early february but only now

to vietnam s communist government that the united states cares about human rights here mr obama spent more than his allotted time with the six vietnamese civil society leaders who did attend the meeting at a jw marriott hotel but he said that several others had been prevented from coming vietnam has made remarkable strides the economy is growing quickly the internet is booming and there s a growing confidence here mr obama said when a group of reporters were briefly allowed into the meeting but as i indicated yesterday there s still areas of significant concerns in terms of areas of free speech freedom of assembly accountability with respect to government politico edward isaac doverepresident barack obama brought his the cold war is really over tour here tuesday after his big speech in havana in february and looking ahead to his final nato summit scheduled for july in poland that s a message that he stressed repeatedly in his televised address to the vietnamese people even as he prepares to head on wednesday to japan for a meeting of the g world leaders the specter of a booted out russia still in the background and it s a message delivered to a communist party that greeted him at its headquarters monday afternoon in a cavernous red carpeted room under a giant gold bust of ho chi minh that seemed quite confident that it s not going anywhere or changing its approach any time soon despite obama s nudging jabs including pointing out publicly in a meeting with civil activists monday that there were several other activists who were invited who were prevented from coming for various reasons reuters matt spetalnick and martin pettyu s president barack obama is set to lay out more of his plan for a stronger alliance with vietnam on tuesday after scrapping an arms ban that was the last big hurdle between two countries drawn together by concern over china s military buildup the removal of a vestige of the vietnam war suggests u s worries about beijing s reclamation of islands in the south china sea and deployment of advanced radars and missile batteries in the disputed region trumped concerns about vietnam s human rights record washington had for years said a lifting of the ban would require concrete steps by vietnam in allowing freedom of speech worship and assembly and releasing political prisoners in a joint news conference on monday with vietnamese counterpart tran dai quang obama said modest human rights improvements had been made and the decision to end the embargo was about the changing dynamic in ties and not based on china new york times mark landler and matthew rosenbergearly on saturday a middle aged pashtun man used forged documents to cross from iran into pakistan a few hours later on a lonely stretch of highway he was incinerated by an american drone it is not exactly clear how the americans tracked mullah akhtar muhammad mansour leader of the afghan taliban to a white sedan rattling across the arid expanse of baluchistan province the united states picked up a mix of phone intercepts and tips from sources american and european officials said and there were reports that pakistan also provided intelligence president obama described mullah mansour s death on monday as an important milestone but the strike was also an illustration of the tangled relationship between washington and islamabad not since mr obama ordered navy seals to hunt down osama bin laden in may has he authorized a military incursion in pakistan as audacious as this one the white house did not inform the pakistanis in advance of the operation which occurred outside the frontier region near afghanistan the one place where pakistan has tolerated american drone strikes in the past by using the military s joint special operations command rather than the c i a to carry out the attack the united states denied pakistan the fig leaf of a covert operation which in the past has given the pakistanis the ability to claim they had been consulted beforehand new york times carl hulsethe house and senate are gearing up for a push before a memorial day break that president obama said congress should not take unless it got some very specific business done mr obama chided lawmakers last week saying they should not leave town at the end of this week unless they reconcile their differences over a zika prevention funding bill and send him public health legislation he is willing to sign they should not be going off on recess before this is done mr obama said about putting resources behind an effort to stop the spread of the mosquito borne virus to the extent that we re not handling this thing on the front end we re going to have bigger problems on the back end but chances of a quick compromise on the legislation seem dim the house has provided only about half as much as the billion approved by the senate both well short of the billion sought by the white house and the house bill would shift money to fight zika from efforts to combat ebola which mr obama compared to robbing peter to pay paul washington post lisa reinveterans affairs secretary robert mcdonald under pressure to be more transparent about how va

"2016-05-10 18:28","DNC Response to Donald Trump Selecting a White Nationalist Leader as a Delegate in California","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org"," donald trump is the candidate that will make america hate again trump s racist xenophobic candidacy continues to fuel a resurgence of white nationalism in the united states and to elevate a man like this shows that trump has neither the temperament nor judgment to serve as president dnc national press secretary mark paustenbachmother jones josh harkinsonon monday evening california s secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the trump campaign for the upcoming republican presidential primary in the state trump s slate includes william johnson one of the country s most prominent white nationalists johnson applied to the trump campaign to be a delegate he was accepted on monday in order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign i william johnson endorse donald j trump for the office of president of the united states i pledge to cast all of my ballots to elect donald j trump on every round of balloting at the republican national convention so that we can make america great again after he signed the trump campaign added his name to the list of delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state johnson got the news that he had been selected by trump in a congratulatory email sent to him by the campaign s california delegate coordinator katie lagomarsino i just hope to show how i can be mainstream and have these views johnson tells mother jones i can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of donald trump and be a good example to everybody johnson says that in his application to be a gop delegate for trump he disclosed multiple details about his background and activism though he did not specifically use the term white nationalist the trump campaign and lagomarsino did not respond to requests for comment whether or not johnson was vetted by the trump campaign the gop front runner would have a hard time claiming ignorance of johnson s extreme views johnson has gained notice during the presidential primary for funding pro trump robocalls that convey a white nationalist message the white race is dying out in america and europe because we are afraid to be called racist johnson says in one robocall pushed out to residential landlines in vermont and minnesota donald trump is not racist but donald trump is not afraid don t vote for a cuban vote for donald trump armed with cash from affluent donors and staffed by what the movement considers to be its top thinkers the afp now dedicates most of its resources to supporting trump and for good reason johnson claims the afp s pro trump robocalls which have delivered johnson s personal cellphone number to voters in seven states have helped the party find hundreds of new members trump is allowing us to talk about things we ve not been able to talk about johnson says so even if he is not elected he has achieved great things on numerous occasions trump has failed to forcefully repudiate this sort of support after being endorsed by former ku klux klan leader david duke in august last year trump simply told bloomberg news i don t need his endorsement i certainly wouldn t want his endorsement i don t need anybody s endorsement asked in february about the robocalls which are funded by johnson through a super pac a trump spokeswoman would only tell cnn that the candidate had disavowed all super pacs offering their support the splc s potok argues that trump has legitimized and mainstreamed hate in ways we haven t seen since the days of george wallace though nobody can say for sure how many people belong to america s largest hate groups the splc has found that the number of such groups grew by percent in reversing years of declines potok worries that trump could fuel the spread of the afp s ideas for years to come johnson is a corporate lawyer who grows persimmons and raises chickens at his acre ranch in a los angeles suburb when i met him recently outside his law office in downtown la s world trade center he was in high spirits he suggested brightly that we walk downstairs to get lunch at a nearby korean restaurant as we sat next to a table of immaculately coiffed korean air flight attendants i mentioned that some might find it surprising that a guy who wrote a book advocating the creation of an all white ethno state was eating a plate of bulgogi beef with kimchee koreans don t have to make korean food he said matter of factly one of the best chinese restaurants i went to in the bay area is owned by a mormon and cooked by a mormon really great chinese food short graying and years old johnson favors pressed white shirts and bookish black framed glasses he grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods in arizona and oregon before moving to japan in to study the language it was there that locals engaged him in open discussions about differences between the races and he came to see america s european heritage as its biggest and most vulnerable asset this trajectory is not uncommon jared taylor head of the white nationalist group american renaissance also speaks fluent japanese and aryan nations founder richard butler became a white supremacist while immersed in the caste system in india in johnson published under a pseudonym amendment to the constitution averting the decline and fall of america a book calling for the abolition of the th and th amendments and the deportation of all nonwhites he tried to sound a practical tone allowing for instance that african americans should receive a rich dowry to enable them to prosper in their homeland the book was a hit on the talk show circuit and johnson suddenly found himself appearing on television alongside neo nazi skinheads and klansmen by his notoriety and clean cut appeal convinced a group of white nationalists in wyoming to tap him to run for dick cheney s vacant congressional seat he garnered a flurry of press coverage when he earned enough signatures to qualify for the ballot around the same time the building housing his california law office was bombed johnson says the fbi accused him of detonating it himself in a bid for more press the bureau declined to comment twenty years later after unsuccessfully running for various other offices johnson became the head of the american freedom party then known as american third position at the request of a group of southern california skinheads johnson s post was supposed to be temporary the skinheads thought i was too extreme to run the organization he explained but they were the ones who ended up dropping out replaced by what has become a sort of white nationalist brain trust party leaders now include a former reagan administration appointee and a professor emeritus at california state university long beach after our korean lunch johnson rushed back up to his office to host the latest episode of for god and country a christian am talk show currently broadcast in california louisiana and texas his filipino american co host the rev ronald tan nodded approvingly as johnson praised trump on the air for busting up the concept of political correctness the show allows johnson to push a trump centric version of white nationalism to a potentially receptive audience up to a point several radio stations in iowa recently canceled the program out of objection to its content during a commercial break johnson fidgeted are you going to quote any more scriptures he asked tan nervously has the station said that we re not christian enough back on the air tan pivoted to samuel comparing trump to king david in addition to promoting trump on the radio and over the phone the afp streams a podcast called the daily trump phenomenon hour it has set up a political harassment hotline for trump supporters who wish to consult with an attorney about being attacked or verbally abused by anti trump protesters johnson has personally spent the trump promotions including for the party the robocalls the radio show and the harassment hotline were all things that johnson mentioned in his application to become a trump delegate he specifically cited an anti romney robocall commissioned in utah this past march which begins in part my name is william johnson i am a farmer and a white nationalist after wrapping up the radio show johnson led me through his office where a brush painted screen hangs alongside shelves stacked with japanese books and dictionaries many of his legal clients it turns out are foreigners who speak english as a second language yet johnson says he sees no problem with trump s isolationist foreign policy even if it hurts his business ideally he d like to give up his practice and serve as trump s secretary of agriculture we ended up in a mirrored conference room to meet with three afp sympathizers two middle aged women and a young man they talked about how trump had enabled a new kind of honest discourse how he wasn t a racist but a racialist and how he had left them feeling emancipated johnson also now finds it easier to be himself for many many years when i would say these things other white people would call me names oh you re a hatemonger you re a nazi you re like hitler he confessed now they come in and say oh you re like donald trump "

"2016-05-24 18:16","Excerpts From DNC Press Call to Discuss Donald Trumpâ€™s Visit to the Los Angeles Area","DNCPress@dnc.org","DNCPress@dnc.org"," for immediate releasemay contact dnc press â lt tel gt excerpts from dnc press call to discuss donald trumpâ s visit to the los angeles areatoday los angeles mayor eric garcetti and chair of the democratic party of orange county henry vandermeir hosted a press call to hold donald trump accountable ahead of his visit to the los angeles area simply put trump is divisive and lacks the temperament to be president and so we cannot afford to give him the keys to the white house please find excerpts below from the call as prepared for delivery mayor eric garcettidonald trump will be making his way to the los angeles area tomorrow and we simply canâ t afford to give him a free pass the fact of the matter is that on issue after issue he is completely out of touch with angelinos letâ s take the minimum wage for instance it just so happens that tomorrow marks the nine year anniversary of the last time americans got a minimum wage increase on may president bush signed into law the fair minimum wage act which raised the federal minimum wage to per hour letâ s also take the recent housing crisis angelinos were hit hard by it and foreclosure signs littered far too many of our streets trump on the other hand was cheerleading for a housing crash so that he could benefit financially to quote trump regarding the housing bubble bursting â i sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy â clearly heâ s only looking out for himself and until trump releases his tax returns itâ s impossible to tell how much he profited while millions of americans were suffering through the worst economic crisis since the great depression finally letâ s talk about the issue of immigration instead of focusing on fixing our countryâ s broken immigration system donald trump has been doing the exact opposite he has been trying to exploit unfounded fears for political gain among other things heâ s called mexicans â rapistsâ and â drug dealersâ he wants to deport million undocumented immigrants he wants to repeal president obamaâ s executive actions dapa and daca and he wants to erect a giant wall along our southern border all while banning muslims from entering our country thatâ s not leadership and thatâ s not who we are as a people we are and will always be a country of immigrants and my story is a testament to that â iâ m absolutely proud to be the grandson of mexican immigrants and for that reason iâ ve made sure to take action on immigration as mayor even though we donâ t have a lot of formal power at the local level our â citizenship cornersâ program is a testament to that as it helps immigrants attain citizenship and so to wrap things up iâ d like to reiterate that donald trump does not represent the values and beliefs of angelinos los angeles is a beautiful and thriving city not because weâ re afraid of diversity but because we embrace it and we make sure that everyone is treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve orange county democratic chair henry vandermeirorange county was once known as the most conservative county in the nation â but the fact of the matter is that itâ s no longer the gop stronghold it once was the republicans have been losing an average of per year in registration over the last decade and now hold just a point voter registration advantage over democrats down from points in â in fact since the beginning of the year when donald trump began winning primaries democratic registration has surged in orange county outpacing republican registration to the three largest cities in the county anaheim santa ana and irvine already have democratic majorities and four of the top five voting blocs are in the democratic column although the democratic party of orange county has worked hard over the past several years to make significant in roads with our targeted registration programs the truth is donald trump has become our best marketing tool he s insulted pretty much every constituency in this county and thatâ s helped drive democratic registration to new highs and so the difference between the two parties has never been clearer than in this election trump has helped to spotlight the difference in our policies and priorities i think thatâ s whatâ s resonating with the people of orange county who understand just how dangerous and divisive trumpâ s candidacy really is unlike the republican party s presumptive presidential nominee our party celebrates and encourages diversity we know that our nation was made great by valuing not vilifying immigrants and people of all faiths both of our presidential candidates have records of inclusiveness and campaign on issues that bring us together so itâ s no surprise that theyâ ve been a huge hit with voters trump s impending nomination is a reminder that for years the republican party has elevated extreme voices and i think the registration numbers clearly show that the people of orange county are not interested in that type of rhetoric "

metro s latest debacle no more mr nice guy after criticism from the ntsb last week that the department of transportation had been toothless in efforts to ensure safety of transit systems administrators are are taking pains to bare some of those sharp incisors secretary anthony foxx told reporters on tuesday that he had seriously considered ordering a shutdown of metrorail last week after video surfaced of an empire strikes back style explosion on a subway platform and subsequent news that wmata safety inspectors had been denied access to the tracks for hours i will have no hesitation to shut down the system all the tools that we have available to us are on the table all of them foxx said he added if metro drags its feet in aggressively following that directive we will be back where we were can foxx really do that indeed dot has the legal authority to shut down metro under a provision included in the fast act check out page restrictions and prohibitions the secretary shall issue restrictions and prohibitions by whatever means are determined necessary and appropriate if through testing inspection investigation audit or research carried out under this chapter the secretary determines that an unsafe condition or practice exist such that there is a substantial risk of death or personal injury resistant to safety our jennifer scholtes recapped foxx s take on the situation foxx said metro s safety culture is still deficient and that even wmata s new track maintenance plan wouldn t have handled the kind of amperage issues dot has ordered the rail service to fix besides trying to determine issues with metro s hardware the department is trying to size up the capability of the people using the hardware some of whom foxx said appear to be resistant to safety protocols it s hard to help somebody who s keeping inspectors off the track for hours at a time he said last thursday did not inspire confidence almost there the energy and water appropriations bill is still on track to pass as soon as today senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday and he confirmed that the transportation hud appropriations bill is the next one headed to the senate floor coupled with the military construction va bill mcconnell told reporters on tuesday that he s optimistic the senate will pass a large number of spending bills but he s frustrated by the pace so far and the extent to which democrats have slowed progress their slogan i gather is do your job i would say to them do your job do your job he said his voice rising the basic work of the senate and the congress and the house is to pass the funding bills that s what we re going to be doing here from now to july never say die art halvorson shuster s just barely vanquished opponent in the pennsylvania primary is pressing a county court to determine if he can become the democratic candidate in the november general election the basis for his argument enough democrats wrote him in on their ballot that he deserves the spot as their candidate i wouldn t change who i am but if the democrats nominated me i d accept that halvorson told the herald mail halvorson lost to shuster in the primary by just over votes dare to dream senators sens richard blumenthal and ed markey came out with an unexpected ask on tuesday they want airlines to stop charging baggage fees this summer insert hysterical laughter here their rationale putting a hiatus on baggage fees could help deal with the long security lines expected at airports around the country this summer encouraging people to check their bags rather than take carry ons and diminishing the amount of time it takes to get passengers through security checkpoints baggage backup significantly slows screening and often boarding airlines should help solve these issues putting passengers before profits markey and blumenthal wrote screening congestion is solvable and this step will help please do not stand idly as travelers stand in endless lines in short yeah right airlines for america s jean medina offered a response to the blumenthal markey proposal we have seen no data to suggest charging customers to check a bag equates to a percent increase in the number of carry on items this is a misguided attempt at reregulating an industry that has been deregulated to the benefit of the consumer since and would have the unintended consequence of making air travel more expensive a a said it s got a better idea on how to cut down wait lines get tsa to send adequate staff and equipment to crowded airports foxx no plans for more takata recalls at tuesday s sitdown with reporters foxx also touched on the ongoing takata airbag recall despite nhtsa s most recent expansion of the recall that almost doubled the number of affected vehicles foxx said he doesn t anticipate the list of recalled vehicles to grow anytime soon he cited the differences between airbags that use desiccant and those that don t and said the agency continues to believe that those with the drying chemical are not a risk to motorists the desiccant in some of the other airbags based on the science and the evidence don t react the same way as the ones without desiccant foxx said and while there have been some ruptures of those other airbags they haven t correlated with the type of problem we re seeing with these other ones at present we don t believe the science and evidence dictates moving toward those other ones but if it does we will obviously not hesitate to move that way as for questions about takata s continued financial health foxx said he s not worried that can t be the top concern we face the information i have is that there is capability to meet the demand based on the type of recall we ve done and if for some reason takata falls out of the equation the manufacturers of the cars are still on the hook to ensure that the recalls happen so there s some redundancy there but frankly if that went into our calculation i don t think that we d deserve to be called a safety agency obama nominates dot undersecretary foxx also weighed in on president barack obama s just announced nomination for dot s new undersecretary of policy blair anderson who is currently serving as nhtsa s deputy administrator his in depth knowledge of the department has been instrumental in helping us tackle some of the most critical issues we face such as advancing connected and automated vehicle technologies the ladders of opportunity initiative and overseeing the largest vehicle safety recall in american history foxx

the script page by page with reiner his wife michelle financier johnson chan and scriptwriter joey hartstone backstory warren told playbook about years ago rob reiner actually called us and told us he s been wanting to do this movie for awhile and we ve been working with him and a script writer for the last two years and things have really accelerated in the last few months it tells the story of how me landay walcott and joe galloway challenged the bush administration s case for war the movie very much tries to show the cost of what was bush s decision the movie does have financing the script has been written and is being tweaked and we have every indication that this project is going to go forward there is no casting yet strobel says he never thought at that time that there could ever be a movie made about the reporting i think i speak for all four of us that this is surreal and surprising we ve talked a lot and joked a lot about who might play the four of us he also hopes to go on set for at least part of the shooting about the message of the film this has been cast often in the public sphere as an intelligence failure but i m hoping the movie will make clear that it really wasn t an intelligence failure that these people wanted to go to war long before the intelligence was clear one way or the other we also hope that it serves as maybe what spotlight did to motivate

eilperin â james hohmann returns from vacation today for a while it looked like criminal justice reform would be the great white whale of this congress that elusive triumph that was just out of reach for the democrats and republicans who believed it was finally within their grasp as lawmakers return to town this week though there are signs it could happen this congressâ though it remains an uphill battle the compromise that saved the senate bill late last month the bipartisan coalition in the senate that has been pushing this initiativeâ including judiciary committee chairman charles e grassley ranking member patrick j leahy d vt and sens richard j durbin d ill john cornyn r tex mike lee r utah and sheldon whitehouse d r i â introduced a revised bill with cosponsors it explicitly excludes anyone convicted of a â serious violent felonyâ from being eligible for early release that compromise helped win the backing of gop sens steve daines mont mark kirk ill thad cochran miss and dan sullivan alaska plus the national district attorneys association the new bill also reduces minimum penalties for low level non violent offenders and allows judges to exercise greater discretion when sentencing low level non violent drug offenders meanwhile the house judiciary committee is planning to press ahead later this month in addition to eight measures that have already passed the panel is slated to mark up bills related to juvenile justice civil asset forfeiture as well as criminal procedures and policing strategies â i think we can get there â house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte r va said in an interview when it comes to the whole package cobbling together all of the parts he added â it is our hope that we can bring it to the floor soon but i canâ t say when because i donâ t know when â the window of opportunity to pass the bill is narrow the closer the election gets the harder it becomes to pass big ticket legislation reform advocates hope the house can pass its bill in june to provide enough time for the senate to act and reconcile its proposal with that of the lower chamber since the senate judiciary committee has already passed a criminal justice bill lawmakers can substitute their revised measure as an amendment on the floor that though depends on mitch mcconnell deciding to bring the bill up for consideration mitch mcconnell reuters jonathan ernst the two biggest hurdles right now mcconnell and mens reathe senate majority leader holds most of the cards right now and heâ s keeping them close to the vest mcconnell has still not said whether the most recent version of the senate bill which has republican co sponsors and democratic co sponsors has sufficient gop support to merit a floor vote he remains nervous that vulnerable gop incumbents could get accused of being soft on crime one of his recurring nightmares is willie horton style ads being run against his members and he is always loathe to highlight divisions among republican senators sens ted cruz texas and tom cotton ark for instance are outspoken critics of this effort on the other hand with donald trump at the top of the ticket passing a marquee bill could give vulnerable republicans something to run on besides merely blocking barack obamaâ s agenda and the growing number of republicans who support the revised bill could tip the balance even with the revisions there are still some serious differences between the two chambersâ proposals the biggest centers around whatâ s known as â mens rea â a legal phrase used to describe state of mind basically the fight boils down to whether prosecutors should be forced to prove that someone intended to break the law specifically when it comes to white collar corporate crimes the house judiciary committee already moved a bill that says when federal criminal law fails to provide a clear standard of intent prosecutors would have to prove defendants â knew or had reason to believe the conduct was unlawful â â there needs to be a significant change in the criminal intent standards â goodlatte said adding the senators â must find a way to deal with the fact that there are over criminal statutes and hundreds of thousands of regulations on the books under which somebody could be charged with a crime â americans for tax reform president grover norquist a signatory to the conservative movementâ s â right on crime statement of principles â said he believes a package has better than odds of passage but he is adamant that there will be no criminal justice reform without mens rea â the idea that the hard left of the democratic party likes to threaten businesspeople with jail for not complying with regulations that theyâ ve written in some cubbyhole somewhere is ridiculous â he said valerie jarrettâ photo by kate patterson for the washington post white house senior adviser valerie jarrett said there could be â unintended consequences â like if a robber took money from a bank without knowing it was federally insured but she emphasized that she believes these differences can be reconciled â we are building momentum in support in both the house and senate and iâ m optimistic

nevada could make it easier for the democratic candidate to retain those swing states even arizona could be in play say some poll watchers registration is a game changer with hispanic voters only about percent of eligible hispanics vote but nearly percent of registered hispanics go to the ballot box the hill rafael bernalarturo vargas executive director of the national association of elected and appointed officials projects million hispanics will vote nationwide in compared to million in and million in many of those new hispanic voters are also expected to vote against trump if he is the republican nominee something that appears much more likely after the front runner s sweeping primary victories tuesday in five east coast states a whopping percent of respondents in a poll of registered hispanic voters in colorado and nevada said trump s views on immigration made them less likely to vote for republicans in november in florida that number was percent the figures are sparking confident tones from democrats who think their party s nominee will benefit from a huge advantage in the fall not only in the presidential race but also in battles for the house and senate because of the contrast between the gop and democratic fields we feel absolutely confident about our chances of electing democrats up and down the ballot in november said walter garcia western regional communication director for the democratic national committee many of the newly registered hispanic voters are in california and texas relatively safe states for democrats and republicans respectively in fact because so many hispanic voters live in those states the effect of the rising registration numbers will be somewhat undercut according to vargas still rising registration rates among hispanics in colorado florida and nevada could make it easier for the democratic candidate to retain those swing states even arizona could be in play say some poll watchers registration is a game changer with hispanic voters only about percent of eligible hispanics vote but nearly percent of registered hispanics go to the ballot box democrats have already targeted colorado florida and nevada with at least million for hispanic outreach according to vargas in colorado where percent of eligible voters are hispanic the demographic has already shown its ability to flip elections president obama won percent of the vote in colorado in compared to percent for gop nominee mitt romney in nevada obama won percent of the vote to romney s percent arizona has been a relatively safe state for republicans in recent presidential elections but democrats have long wondered if they could make it competitive romney won percent of the vote there in obama percent david lublin professor of government at american university describes arizona as the sort of state that if clinton starts moving into landslide or big win territory she could win obama won percent of the hispanic vote in according to exit polls by nbc a democrat in would likely depend on larger hispanic turnout and a larger share of the white vote to win the state romney hurt himself with hispanic voters in by suggesting that undocumented workers self deport he moved to the right on immigration and border security in the primary and was relatively quiet on the issue in the general election both parties think trump s rhetoric which has included insults directed at mexicans and a plan to build a wall on the border and make mexico pay for it could be more difficult to overcome in a general election trump has motivated latino voters said rep norma torres d calif immigration was shown by an america s voice latino decisions poll to be the primary issue driving hispanics away from republican candidates in however hispanic voters nationally said the most important issue facing the country is the economy ruth guerra republican national committee director of hispanic media gives little credence to the polls not only is latino decisions on hillary clinton s payroll they have proven to be inaccurate time and again so we will take their results in context she also criticized clinton the likely democratic nominee on immigration issues accusing her of thinking hispanics would have amnesia she noted that clinton was opposed to giving drivers licenses to undocumented workers as a senator from new york but has now reversed her position clinton s flip flops and hypocrisy on immigration are a mile long because she will tell voters anything to win an election guerra said a win by a democrat presidential candidate in florida colorado and nevada would make it very difficult for a gop candidate to reach electoral votes and win the white house in fact democrats could actually lose the swing state of ohio but win pennsylvania or wisconsin and get to simply by holding other states that have voted for the democratic nominee in presidential elections for the last six cycles jon ralston a veteran nevada political journalist who is not surprised by the numbers said the real problem is that trump and to a lesser degree cruz will drive up hispanic turnout against republicans he said the only path for the gop nominee to the white house in such a situation would be to win more white votes ralston described this as a path we have never seen before huge increase in white vote if the numbers hold true the electoral map becomes daunting for republicans with the three states in question turned solid blue based on towin s toss up map democrats would only have to win one of either wisconsin ohio pennsylvania virginia or north carolina or a more unlikely combination of only new hampshire and iowa if the hispanic vote does indeed deliver colorado florida and nevada it s not a

especially when that company is bearing checks alex sink learned this the hard way when an invitation for her monday fundraiser in miami beach listed two donors with checkered pasts the leading democratic contender for governor a buttoned down former banker decided to dump both donors for fear they would be used to smear her the first casualty was former miami city commissioner johnny winton who was booted from office in after a drunken and profane run in with police sink removed him as a co host of the fundraiser on wednesday some strategists saw that as a no brainer for a campaign that made a rookie mistake by failing to background big donors others said sink would have created less fuss had she stood by winton and wasn t she was boxing herself in so every donor with a less than perfect profile would be questioned on friday they did turns out that one of the event s co chairs george lindemann wealthy chairman of the bass art musem s board of trustees served time for ordering a hit on his show horse and collecting in insurance money he was sentenced in to months in prison we make decisions on a case by case basis and lindemann was convicted of insurance fraud said sink spokeswoman tara klimek this particular circumstance is over the line sink s rejection of winton and lindemann raises questions about where candidates should draw the line when vetting donors is a pending investigation cause for concern or only a conviction is slugging a cop as bad as arranging the killing of a horse and what s the statute of limitations on these matters another co chair of the sink reception publicist seth gordon was removed as a volunteer campaign advisor to miami dade state attorney katherine fernandez rundlein after police told her he was a suspect in the death of his first wife gordon has denied murdering her and never been charged gordon who recruited lindemann to help sink defended his friend and noted his involvement in civic causes george doesn t deserve to continue to be a punching bag he has contributed to every democratic presidential candidate and no one has ever suggested that they didn t want his money gordon said indeed lindemann has donated generously to a slew of candidates including u s rep kendrick meek u s sen bill nelson and former presidential contender hillary clinton so it s okay to cash his checks but not to give him top billing on a fundraising invite even florida s master politician gov charlie crist has struggled with this issue at first he stood by a top fundraiser in developer sergio pino whose relationship with a county commissioner was under federal investigation pino also had been tied to potential election law violations while raising money for former gov jeb bush we re happy to have his support a crist spokeswoman said five days later pino stepped down crist said of his decision i think it was the right thing to do the miami herald the rielle deal how local scandal begets national scandal in the charged world of fort lauderdale politics and businessrielle hunter who was born in fort lauderdale years ago has had an alarmingly eventful life as a teenager she was an accomplished equestrienne who rode a champion jumping horse until the animal was electrocuted in its stable by a hit man from chicago part of one of the biggest scandals to ever hit florida s blueblood horse set as a blond and pretty young woman her voracious appetite for cocaine and men caught the attention of novelist jay mcinerney who based a lead character on her in a bestselling book about the excesses of the s now in middle age she s become a notorious national media celebrity as the femme fatale in the scandal that has all but destroyed the political career of former democratic presidential candidate john edwards it s been a wild wandering and wanton life for hunter who spent her childhood in tamarac as lisa jo druck her given name and to understand hunter she married divorced and kept her ex husband s name it s instructive to look back at those years in fort lauderdale specifically at the untold story of her father james druck who was a powerful attorney in downtown fort lauderdale for nearly two decades

if we republicans choose donald trump as our nominee the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished in that march speech mr romney advanced a plan to deprive mr trump of the votes he needs to win the republican presidential nomination without a convention fight in july mr romney proposed that the candidate in the best position to beat mr trump in each state should run unimpeded by other contenders after losing in new york senator ted cruz and gov john kasich seemed ready to embrace this idea late sunday they announced that mr cruz would run hard in indiana s may primary and mr kasich though he was favored in suburbs surrounding indianapolis would stand down in that state mr kasich in turn would focus on beating mr trump in new mexico and oregon unimpeded by mr cruz but within hours they backed away as mr cruz s campaign quietly told supporters not to engage in tactical voting and mr kasich said that although he wouldn t hold rallies he d still attend a

asset resolution group an affiliate of fort lauderdale based bbx capital nyse bbx filed a lawsuit in june against turnberry doral development jeffrey soffer and jacquelyn soffer over a million mortgage that was originated by bankatlantic the lawsuit was not a foreclosure but sought to force the borrowers to repay the loan south florida business journal january settlement appears likely in fontainebleau las vegas bankruptcy case fontainebleau las vegas the soffers are on the verge of settling with creditors over the debacle once known as the fontainebleau las vegas a still skeletal billion high rise in sin city that ranks as one of the biggest busts of the u s real estate crisis a federal bankruptcy judge in miami said wednesday he was inclined to approve a million settlement that would pay contractors on the failed casino tower about cents on the dollar contractors would divvy up about million for a total claims pool of million but which a creditor lawyer said would probably end up closer to million once negotiations are finished the money will be paid out to creditors and lawyers in arbitration or by court order a process that could add another year or two onto a case that began with a chapter bankruptcy filing in june construction lenders would recoup about million i certainly have sympathy for all of the people who have money coming to them and seem to have been waiting forever judge a jay cristol told an audience about lawyers half of them participating by speaker phone at an afternoon hearing in downtown miami the settlement money would come from the million in sale proceeds paid by corporate raider carl icahn when he bought the unfinished tower out of bankruptcy in the money has been in an frozen escrow account pending the bankruptcy outcome an additional million would come from title companies that backed the project as well as from a million completion guarantee funded by jeff soffer and his sister jacquelyn the brother and sister team run the family s real estate firm turnberry which got its start with the creation of aventura and now includes both the aventura mall and the fontainebleau miami beach the story fontainebleau vegas is described in court papers as essentially a tear down valuable for its land on the north end of the strip but burdened by a five year old unfinished tower that icahn may demolish while judge cristol said the settlement would probably meet his approval he said he would consider written objections by a las vegas contractor who wanted its million lawsuit against jeff soffer protected from the settlement a million settlement by mr soffer to get out of all the problems he is currently facing is not a large amount said henry marinello a miami lawyer representing the tracy and ryder landscape inc a large nevada based landscaping contractor the settlement would end claims by lenders and contractors in the bankruptcy case but the soffers still face litigation involving the fontainebleau vegas jeff soffer the lead developer in both fontainebleau projects has blamed the vegas debacle on lehman brothers cutting off funds after it collapsed in followed by some of the nation s top banks holding back about million in construction funds slated for completing the project but lenders accused soffer and his development team at turnberry of mismanagement and over spending allegations repeated by the bankruptcy trustee in a separate suit seeking damages from soffer and his top executives that litigation is still pending and will not be covered by the settlement the soffers did not attend the hearing jeff soffer presided over fontainebleau vegas and put in million cash collateral for the million completion guarantee before the project started in his sister became part of the guarantee when she bought a judgment from a lender that had successfully sued to force jeff to pay the remaining million both soffers claimed they should get the money back since the funds could only be used to complete a project that now had no hope of being finished the two essentially surrendered their claims to the money as part of the settlement said mario romine general counsel for turnberry associates soneet kapila a fort lauderdale accountant appointed as bankruptcy trustee for the case blamed the four years leading up to the a settlement on the fact that the case is one of the most complicated ever to be heard in south florida when it is high level and sophisticated litigation there are a lot of things to resolve he said it s the nature of it the miami herald november previously resolved issues by dnc vet com soffers settle dispute with bank over las vegas fontainebleau deutsche bank trust co americas and a soffer family partnership have apparently resolved a million dispute regarding the fontainebleau las vegas jacquelyn soffer has been substituted as the plaintiff for deutsche bank in the case which would give her the right to collect million in principal in interest plus attorneys fees in new york state supreme court the billion project was never completed soffer s brother jeffrey was described by deutsche bank as being in control of the partnership and named as a defendant jacquelyn soffer was not lenders including bankrupt lehman brothers have filed lawsuits alleging jeff soffer still owes hundreds of millions for personal guarantees on financing for the stalled hotel casino resort complex in las vegas which carl icahn purchased for million in january the soffer family and turnberry also have counterclaims against the las vegas resort s lenders the counterclaims which use details from an examiner s report about the collapse of lehman said lehman hid its true financial condition jeff soffer signed a settlement agreement with the bank in january but the counterclaims are still pending as part of the agreement deutsche bank assigned to jackie soffer all of its rights title and interest in the causes of action actually asserted in this action including the right to have judgment entered against the defendants herein a logical question is why would a bank substitute a defendant s sister in collecting the judgement attempts to obtain an

challenger but failed to follow through on the agreement lawsuit describes art blacklist to keep some collectors away imagine a market for highly sought after items in which the makers and sellers work hard to ensure that the items go only to certain buyers even if other buyers might be willing to pay more the favored buyers are then expected not to resell the items for many years even if the values skyrocket ideally in fact the buyers are expected to give these items away eventually for the public good and if the buyers don t abide by these expectations they risk being cut off cast out with the other unwashed wealthy who can afford to buy but have no access at least according to craig robins a prominent miami art collector and real estate developer who filed a federal lawsuit on march in manhattan this is a portrait of the workings of the primary market for contemporary art which despite the recession remains immense and highly competitive at its heart the million suit is a fairly ordinary contract dispute about confidentiality agreements and sales promises but the details of the disagreement have provided a rare view into a normally very private world of high end art selling in which membership rules responsibilities rewards and reprisals can be so complex and changeable that even art world veterans say they sometimes struggle to decode them mr robins asserts that he sold a painting of a dark figure by the highly praised south african born artist marlene dumas through the david zwirner gallery in chelsea in with an agreement that the sale remain confidential but the gallery which did not yet represent ms dumas told her about it mr robins claims causing her to become angry with him because like many artists she prefers to see her paintings remain long term in prominent collections mr robins says that ms dumas one of whose paintings sold for more than million at sotheby s in maintains an active blacklist of those she views as speculating in her work a blacklist that he says he is now on and whose existence his lawyers who were back in court on the case this week say they plan to prove the suit which claims million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from the gallery also claims that mr zwirner promised to help get mr robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from against the wall the current show of ms dumas s work at zwirner which is now her gallery but that this did not happen in its legal response the gallery has called the suit baseless saying it had never promised choice works or confidentiality after the sale by bringing suit the gallery s lawyers argue the wealthy robins has literally made a federal case of not being able to buy what he wants when he wants as for the supposed blacklist the lawyers added as if addressing a purely philosophical problem if such a list exists and if robins is on it zwirner did not put him there and cannot take him off but several dealers art advisers and collectors specializing in contemporary art said in recent interviews that with the explosion of the art market over the last several years and a sharp rise in the number of speculative buyers entering the market those who sell art have become much more wary of collectors motives and that they keep in addition to secret waiting lists for in demand artists another even more secret list of buyers suspected of wanting to flip art for a quick profit even serious collectors who are generally regarded more as keepers than as sellers complain that in recent years several dealers and highly involved artists like ms dumas have gone overboard in their protectiveness and desire to control an artwork s destiny after it is sold i think sometimes there s a fair amount of hypocrisy from some of these dealers said adam lindemann a longtime collector and author of a book collecting contemporary that offers advice to aspiring collectors i m not buying a can of sardines here mr lindemann said i m buying something that i m in love with but times change and sometimes you need to sell things mr robins s suit and a similar one filed in against a new york dealer by a prominent european collector jean pierre lehmann who also complained of an inability to buy choice works are seen as evidence by some within the collecting world that the contemporary art market has become so contentious that even serious long term collectors are now being pushed into fights mr robins for example owns works by ms dumas and has called her one of the top three artists in my collection mr zwirner and ms dumas declined to comment about the lawsuit mr robins s lawyer aaron richard golub also declined to comment except to offer a general observation about dealers they might say they re motivated by trying to place pieces in museums and the right collections and such but at the end of the day it s all about profit nexis the new york times high flying partners dispute jet

"2016-05-02 07:25","Clinton fundraising leaves little for state parties","email@politicoemail.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," clinton fundraising leaves little for state partiesby kenneth p vogel and isaac arnsdorf am edtin the days before hillary clinton launched an unprecedented big money fundraising vehicle with state parties last summer she vowed to rebuild our party from the ground up proclaiming when our state parties are strong we win that s what will happen but less than percent of the million raised by that effort has stayed in the state parties coffers according to a politico analysis of the latest federal election commission filings the venture the hillary victory fund is a so called joint fundraising committee comprised of clinton s presidential campaign the democratic national committee and state party committees the set up allows clinton to solicit checks of or more from her super rich supporters at extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at george clooney s house and at a concert at radio city music hall featuring katy perry and elton john the victory fund has transferred million to the state parties but almost all of that cash million or percent was quickly transferred to the dnc usually within a day or two by the clinton staffer who controls the committee politico s analysis of the fec records found by contrast the victory fund has transferred million to clinton s campaign and million to the dnc which will work closely with clinton s campaign if and when she becomes the party s nominee and most of the million spent directly by the victory fund has gone towards expenses that appear to have directly benefited clinton s campaign including million for salary and overhead and million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from clinton campaign ads and that has helped clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of billion the arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and allies of clinton s democratic rival bernie sanders they see it as a circumvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus intent on doing whatever it takes to help clinton defeat sanders during the party s primary and then win the white house but it is perhaps more notable that the arrangement has prompted concerns among some participating state party officials and their allies they grumble privately that clinton is merely using them to subsidize her own operation while her allies overstate her support for their parties and knock sanders for not doing enough to help the party it s a one sided benefit said an official with one participating state party the official like those with several other state parties declined to talk about the arrangement on the record for fear of drawing the ire of the dnc and the clinton campaign in fact the dnc which has pushed back aggressively on charges that it is boosting clinton at the expense of other democrats has advised state party officials on how to answer media inquiries about the arrangement multiple sources familiar with the interactions told politico the dnc has given us some guidance on what they re saying but it s not clear what we should be saying said the official i don t think anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party because we do need their resources but everyone who entered into these agreements was doing it because they were asked to not because there are immediately clear benefits some fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state parties they worry that participating states that aren t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive senate races could see very little return investment from the dnc or clinton s campaign and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for them and for party committees in contested states there s another risk they might find themselves unable to accept cash from rich donors whose checks to the victory fund counted towards their donation limit to the state party in question even if that party never got to spend the cash because it was transferred to the dnc sources working with the hillary victory fund said the committee is sensitive to these concerns and that state parties were asked to submit names of donors they wanted to save for themselves clinton s campaign and the dnc argue that all democratic politicians and state parties even those that aren t enrolled in the victory fund will benefit from its fundraising that s because the cash will go towards enhancing national voter data and research and communications efforts that all state parties are entitled to and josh schwerin a spokesman for clinton s campaign suggested that a handful of key state parties last month received another in transfers from the victory fund and enjoyed other benefits from it that will be detailed in subsequent fec reports the latest reports only cover through the end of march about million has already been transferred to state parties and there is an additional million on hand that will be distributed over the coming months as state parties ramp up for the general election he said in an email he added that in april money raised through the hvf has started to be used to fund democratic coordinated campaigns across the country which will help strengthen the party and elect democrats up and down the ballot but schwerin did not respond to follow up questions about how much of the in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently transferred to the dnc dnc spokesman mark paustenbach pointed out that the national party committee offered to engage in the same joint fundraising efforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle and we welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the dnc and state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in november sanders campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising agreement with the dnc but the committee has been largely inactive instead after sanders was chided by clinton allies for not helping down ballot democrats he sent out appeals to his vaunted email list that helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a trio of progressive house candidates who got to keep all the cash the hillary victory fund by contrast allows the clinton campaign to maintain tight control over the cash it raises and spends the fund represents by far the most ambitious use to date of a joint fundraising committee and arguably one the most ambitious hard dollar fundraising efforts in modern presidential politics until the most an individual could have given to such a committee was but in april of that year the supreme court in a case called mccutcheon vs fec struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor wanted that paved the way for massive joint fundraising committees which could accept ever larger checks based on how the number and type of committees that agreed to participate in the case of the hillary victory fund the maximum donation in is based on maximum donations of to hillary for america for the primary election to the dnc and to the federal accounts of each of the state parties after politico revealed that the victory fund was asking for couples to donate or raise a whopping in order to sit at a table with clinton george clooney and his wife attorney amal clooney at a fundraiser last month in san francisco clooney admitted that was an obscene amount of money but he justified it by saying the overwhelming amount of the money that we re raising is not going to hillary to run for president it s going to the down ticket according to the agreements signed by the participating committees which were obtained by politico the money is required to be distributed at least initially based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the participants the first goes to clinton campaign the next goes to the dnc and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties but what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the clinton campaign its chief operating officer beth jones is the treasurer of the victory fund and fec filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the dnc which sanders supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the clinton campaign for example the minnesota democratic farmer labor party received from the victory fund on nov only to transfer the same amount to the dnc that same day the pattern repeated itself after the minnesota party received transfers from the victory fund of on dec the party sent the same amount to the dnc the next day and on jan it transferred the same amount to the dnc that day that means that minnesota s net gain from its participation in the victory fund was precisely through the end of march meanwhile the dnc pocketed an extra in cash routed through minnesota much of which the dnc wouldn t have been able to accept directly since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee a similar pattern transpired with most of the participating state parties as of march only eight state parties most of which were in battleground states such as colorado florida nevada new hampshire and virginia had received more from the victory fund than was transferred from their accounts to the dnc but even if state parties aren t getting to keep the victory fund cash they benefit from money spent to enhance the dnc s data research and design services said jeremy kennedy the executive director of the maine democratic state committee which is a victory fund participant in my opinion strengthening the state parties strengthens the dnc and vice versa kennedy said i d be the first one to tell you if i felt differently his party received from the victory fund but transferred that exact amount to the dnc though kennedy said he hopes that money will find its way back to benefit the party in maine while state party officials were made aware that clinton s campaign would control the movement of the funds between participating committees one operative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of their officials have complained that they weren t notified of the transfers into and out of their accounts until after the fact that s despite their stipulations in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required before such transfers could be made from their accounts but the operative said that the state party officials are reluctant to complain to the dnc about the arrangement out of fear of financial retribution particularly the parties in states that are not competitive they worry that the dnc won t let them keep any of the money but the historical reality is that they wouldn t have gotten the money anyway the operative said asked about whether the victory fund has taken steps to keep the state parties apprised of the transfers schwerin said we work closely with all parties involved and all transfers occur in accordance with the joint fundraising agreements amalgamated bank the union run bank that handles the accounts for the victory fund as well as clinton s campaign and the dnc did not directly address the complaints about money being transferred without consent of the state party committees we do not comment on the account activity of any customers other than to say that all clients enjoy the highest standards of security protocols and safeguards to ensure only listed account owners or their designated agents are able to execute transactions of any kind and of course always in full compliance of all banking laws said bank spokesman loren riegelhaupt another area in which critics contend the hillary victory fund appears to be pushing the bounds of joint fundraising is in its online advertising campaign which has included many ads urging readers to stop trump or to support clinton while joint fundraising committees are allowed to pay for ads as part of their fundraising efforts they are forbidden from funding campaign advertising urging voters to vote for or against specific candidates those types of ads qualify as electioneering expenses that are supposed to be paid for directly by the campaign or by party committees schwerin said the stop trump ads aren t urging readers to vote against trump all of hvf s activities including online ads are for fundraising purposes he said most of the victory funds ads were executed by the same firm that does advertising for clinton s campaign bully pulpit interactive which has been paid million by the hillary victory fund for online advertising and million by hillary for america for online advertising and media buys those victory fund ads as well as a direct mail campaign funded by the same committee appear to benefit only the clinton campaign by generating low dollar contributions that flow only to hfa rather than to the dnc or any of the participating state party committees charged sanders campaign lawyer in an open letter sent to the dnc in april it alleged that the victory fund was essentially a pass through to allow clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally accept in a news release accompanying the letter sanders campaign manager jeff weaver argued it is unprecedented for the dnc to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest clinton s campaign manager robby mook called the letter a shameful and irresponsible fundraising ploy and urged sanders to think about what he can do to help the party he is seeking to lead to view online "

that john cornyn said he gave trump some tips on how to discuss illegal immigration more sensitively to woo hispanic voters i love getting advice trump deadpanned it s just what i need just what i

has the wheel for another day trump referendum this year the presidential race isn t a clear referendum on the outgoing president incumbent and whether he will effectively get four more years through hillary clinton this is a referendum on donald trump the reality show candidate the infotainment ringmaster the twitter meister as marshall mcluhan put it long ago the medium is the message just watch today s sunday talk shows there are two major themes wwtd what will trump do and wdtd what did trump do are you not entertained hillary s playing the politician game while trump s playing the entertainer game the entertainer game is a lot more exciting and maybe more persuasive too says one top never trump republican who summed up the mood of the shocked and somewhat revolted gop establishment this was a lament not a point of pride whether it s a path to general election victory is another matter alexburnsnyt this is a nonsensical figure if it includes all coverage including critical investigative trump gaffe coverage both lundry and burns are right to burns point the estimates of trump s media time don t quantify critical coverage and there s plenty of it but to lundry s there are also shows that function like an in kind contribution machine for trump that nods uncritically along when he say ties his opponent s father to jfk s assassin who they are out of the spotlight some say there is a softer side of trump by boston globe s matt viser interviews with former business colleagues campaign rivals and others who have known trump up close say there is a jarring juxtaposition between the trump they know and the trump they see these days on tv m any people who ve met with him describe almost universally as charming though not the slightest self effacing trump who has called senator lindsey graham a nut job disgrace and one of the dumbest human beings i ve ever seen was suddenly on the other end of the line last week in a private conversation

in the u s senate marco rubio got a stark reminder saturday that the national tv media cares a lot more about you know who than it does about say urban poverty so rubio was shocked shocked when the today show on saturday didn t devote enough in depth coverage to what he calls the slum like conditions of jacksonville s eureka gardens run by a hud contractor so rubio let the today show have it on

possible privatization of security at airports to leverage tsa by chicago tribune s bill ruthhart mayor rahm emanuel is seeking to use the threat of privatizing security screening at o hare and midway airports to leverage the transportation security administration into beefing up inadequate chicago staffing that has left travelers waiting in huge lines and rescheduling missed flights a group of influential aldermen introduced a resolution wednesday calling on emanuel s administration to apply for the tsa screening partnership program which would allow city hall to contract with federally

after a protracted and unnecessary legal battle with friends of the parks it is not often that architecture can provide solutions to what are fundamentally political and social problems however this

of bashar assad to abide by the truce washington and moscow reached the agreement on aleppo and surrounding areas late tuesday the arrangement comes two months after a nationwide cease fire took

who was booted from office in after a drunken and profane run in with police sink removed him as a co host of the fundraiser on wednesday some strategists saw that as a no brainer for a campaign that made a rookie mistake by failing to background big donors others said sink would have created less fuss had she stood by winton and wasn t she was boxing herself in so every donor with a less than perfect profile would be questioned â on friday they did turns out that one of the event s co chairs george lindemann wealthy chairman of the bass art musem s board of trustees served time for ordering a hit on his show horse and collecting in insurance money he was sentenced in to months in prison we make decisions on a case by case basis and lindemann was convicted of insurance fraud said sink spokeswoman tara klimek this particular circumstance is over the line sink s rejection of winton and lindemann raises questions about where candidates should draw the line when vetting donors is a pending investigation cause for concern or only a conviction is slugging a cop as bad as arranging the killing of a horse and what s the statute of limitations on these matters another co chair of the sink reception publicist seth gordon was removed as a volunteer campaign advisor to miami dade state attorney katherine fernandez rundlein after police told her he was a suspect in the death of his first wife gordon has denied murdering her and never been charged gordon who recruited lindemann to help sink defended his friend and noted his involvement in civic causes george doesn t deserve

charged world of fort lauderdale politics and businessrielle hunter who was born in fort lauderdale years ago has had an alarmingly eventful life as a teenager she was an accomplished equestrienne who rode a champion jumping horse until the animal was electrocuted in its stable by a hit man from chicago part of one of the biggest scandals to ever hit florida s blueblood horse set as a blond and pretty young woman her voracious appetite for cocaine and men caught the attention of novelist jay mcinerney who based a lead character on her in a bestselling book about the excesses of the s now in middle age she s become a notorious national media celebrity as the femme fatale in the scandal that has all but destroyed the political career of former democratic presidential candidate john edwards it s been a wild wandering and wanton life for hunter who spent her childhood in tamarac as lisa jo druck her given name and to understand hunter she married divorced and kept her ex husband s name it s instructive to look back at those years in fort lauderdale specifically at the untold story of her father james druck who was a powerful attorney in downtown fort lauderdale for nearly two decades â once the family was transplanted to ocala things only got worse in a particularly nasty turn of events druck hired an assassin named tommy the sandman burns to kill his daughter s horse henry the hawk for the insurance money the event deeply traumatized his daughter who was near the stable when the horse was electrocuted burns later admitted to federal investigators that he had killed about horses one of those sentenced to prison in the case was george lindemann jr a palm beach scion to a billion dollar fortune like druck he also had burns kill a show horse for the insurance money â hunter who was with a boyfriend when burns killed the animal saw the horse dead on the stable floor mcinerney fictionalized the account in his book the story of my life the character based on hunter named allison poole recounts that she was so distraught by the killing of the horse named dangerous dan in the book that she had to be kept on tranquilizers for a week â the book was published before the edwards scandal broke and the poole character would also be included in american psycho a bestselling novel by bret easton ellis james druck died in of lung cancer before he could be brought to justice on the insurance fraud charge the rest of the story quite literally is history new times broward palm beach â convict contributions â sen charles schumer d n y has accepted thousands of

while republican voters will continue to be dismayed with the chaos on their side in the last primary in new york exit polls showed that nearly out of every democratic voters believe that our primary has energized our party that s because our two candidates have consistently offered strong well thought out visions for our country that would move america forward that s consistent with wisconsin where out of democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our candidates that s something we re not seeing on the republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues not to mention their judgment and temperament given how ugly divisive and insulting they ve been their own voters know it just of republicans in new york thought their campaign has energized their party in wisconsin out of republican primary voters let me say that again republican primary voters said they fear what a trump presidency would do to our country and roughly a third would rather stay home vote for a third party or vote for a democrat than support either trump or cruz that s stunning but it tells you that democrats are heading into november in a far stronger position than republicans talking pointschaos in cleveland vs our next president in philadelphiawe re less than days from the july conventions and it s clear that democrats will emerge united while republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency both hillary clinton and bernie sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual democratic nominee just yesterday senator sanders said at a town hall on msnbc that he will do everything in his power to make sure no republican gets into the white house in november and secretary clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we ve made under democratic leadership over the last years because the party s platform is a statement of our values the dnc is committed to an open inclusive and representative process both of our campaigns will be represented on the platform drafting committee and just as we did in and the public will have opportunities to participate democrats know that we re stronger when more voices are heard and when we stand together to move our country forward we ll see that in philadelphia at our convention we ll see our next president on our stage at the democratic convention in cleveland compare that to the republicans this week the increasingly desperate cruz and kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop trump but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was happening one third of trump supporters said they would abandon the republican party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third party candidate even republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive convention you ve already seen republican candidates in tight races like senator kirk in illinois and john mccain the gop nominee eight years ago say they will not attend their own convention in cleveland but don t let them fool you they re not any better than the top of their ticket joint fundraising committees we welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the dnc and state parties which is why we stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the clinton campaign and the sanders campaign early in the cycle the dnc is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect democrats up and down the ballot in november it s important to note the funds that the dnc and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen for example our national voter file and communications research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates that includes training across a variety of areas for example and access to media monitoring and rapid response support this is helping us build infrastructure for the general election these arrangements are not new or unusual similar joint fundraising committees were established with our democratic candidate in both and and again both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds and let s be clear neither the dnc nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign for whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising united convention arizona lawsuit we re going to be united at our convention and we re confident in our process which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates we ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise ultimately secretary clinton and senator sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another but their differences remain focused on how to best move america forward o they re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the american people that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive and that we respect everyone in america if you want to talk about a rigged process let s focus on the real problem we re seeing across the country the democratic national committee and the democratic senatorial campaign committee are suing officials in arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their march primaries and many to be disenfranchised as a result we want to make sure that doesn t happen in november if you want to talk about rigging elections that s the real example and it s a serious problem and we re glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the american people to vote in maricopa county officials reduced the number of polling locations to just for every people that s seven times what it was in other parts of the state and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that republicans are championing all across the country and it s not just arizona you had a member of congress from wisconsin glenn grothman who flat out said that they expected they could now win wisconsin because of the voter id law it was his kevin mccarthy moment and the type of rigging of the system we re not going to put up with when voters go to the polls in november they can be certain that the democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief and that s not something you can say about the republican candidates gop frontrunner trump is reckless and dangerous on abortion trump has taken multiple positions on abortion from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion to saying he would allow states to restrict women s rights to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments cruz the vast majority of his republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him lindsey graham crassly talked about how no one in the senate would object if he was killed on the senate floor and said that endorsing him over trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot senator jim risch of idaho twice gave one of the most passive non endorsement endorsements i ve ever seen it s going to be very difficult for senators and congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don t like the gop s problem with women voterstrump is viewed unfavorably by out of women but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term in the past the republican candidates have opposed equal pay family leave and voted against the violence against women act earlier this month we marked equal pay day the day in when women s earnings have caught up with men s earnings from on average we earn cents to their dollar and it s worse for women of color all of the republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace john kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don t need workplace protections just a change of heart among major employers ted cruz voted against the paycheck fairness act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a show vote donald trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did as good a job as men republicans to blame for trump and his down ballot impactit s fitting that donald trump is the standard bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long since they ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security they ve given birthers like trump a pass and fueled the tea party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy then while in office the only thing republicans have done in washington over the last seven years is obstruct trump is the republican party advantage democratsdespite all the media attention that republican frontrunner trump gets with his say anything strategy democrats are winning where it matters senator clinton has earned more than million votes over a million more than donald trump while senator sanders has earned more than million votes well ahead of ted cruz and john kasich while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors if there is an enthusiasm gap it clearly favors democrats democrats will have the strongest candidate in november period and we are poised to take back the senate and make serious gains in the house broad contrast and infrastructure we have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the republicans nominate we see the numbers of course it s clear trump is far ahead of his competitors and we re ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention but we don t think taking on trump is fundamentally different from any of the others at least with trump he s not shy about exposing what the republican brand has truly become ted cruz and john kasich are every bit as extreme as their party s front runner they just hide it a bit better they promise the same extreme agenda on women s rights they deny the threat of climate change and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship they all want to drag america back to the failed economic policies of the last republican president who left office losing jobs a month and having plunged our country into the great recession and they ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric using language that alienates our allies helps isis recruit terrorists and makes america less safe so if it is trump we re ready maybe it s cruz but it s hard to see how that comes together in the end but regardless we re building a ground game and an infrastructure that s ready to challenge him on every single position he s taking on the campaign trail and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the american people democratic national committee"

missing","morningmoney@politico.com","kaplanj@dnc.org"," by ben white am edtthe fed set to hike in june how quickly the cw has changed we ve gone from no way the fed hikes in june before the brexit vote to yeah they are going to move in june our event with atlanta fed president lockhart and san francisco fed president williams helped move things in that direction and minutes from the last meeting only served to increase the odds ihs s sara johnson and ozlem yaylaci most participants judged that if incoming data show improvements on the labor market and inflation fronts it would be appropriate to increase the target federal funds rate in june after the fomc minutes were released futures markets assigned percent probability of a hike in june pantheon s ian shepherdson the recent data have indeed pointed clearly tomuch stronger growth in the second quarter and many at the fed clearly don t believe growth was anything like as weak as the official data in q so the risk of a hike in june is higher than the percent implied by futures at the time of writing it s not a slam dunk though the risk of a brexit vote just eight days after the fomc meeting cited by some members as a threat points to caution on the part of the fed mufg s chris rupkey net net it looks like june s the one what a great kickoff for the summer and the bond market sorely needs a rate hike as activity is moribund and everyone has virtually stopped speculating on higher interest rates ever the bottom line is if growth bounces back in the second quarter then it would likely be appropriate to raise rates in june itc positive on tpp the u s international trade commission released its much anticipated report on the trans pacific partnership s impact on the u s economy the agency found the trade deal

politically to see trump supporting anything that could be portrayed as easing oversight on the biggest banks his constituency is still too angry over the financial crisis so he can call for simpler

remind myself that donald trump is the republican nominee the bewildered reid said during a conference call with reporters on thursday it hasn t sunk in yet for me but it s true that s reality he added and with that reid began to reprise his role as a democratic attack dog which he vibrantly embraced in the campaign against then nominee mitt romney he went after trump s wealth and his at times inflammatory statements as well as republican leaders refusal to confirm a supreme court nominee in favor of waiting for a theoretical trump administration politico david bernsteinfor elizabeth warren maybe not running for president wasn t such a bad idea after all one of the great disappointments for fans of the massachusetts senator a huge devoted following of progressive democrats across the country has been watching their hero sit out the presidential contest as hillary clinton struggles to clinch the nomination and a rumpled socialist from vermont manages to galvanize crowds of young people with a warren esque platform there s a powerful current of sadness that warren might have just dropped her best chance to push her economic equality agenda at the highest levels in washington but now with a trump nomination changing the electoral landscape it looks like they may be selling her far too short one possibility is that clinton could pick warren as her running mate as a way to throw a powerful bone to the bernie sanders left putting warren a mere heartbeat away from the oval office but another more likely prospect is now floating into view between warren s powerful fundraising chops and the potential for a donald trump candidacy to push senate seats into democratic hands the next senate could see a whole new power bloc with warren at the head the hill harper

arms ban is lifted but big ticket items aren t on the horizon reports our colleague austin wright the vietnamese air force won t be flying the most advanced u s fighter jets anytime soon president barack obama s just announced decision to fully lift the decades old ban on lethal arms sales to vietnam is a symbolically important step that analysts say could lead to more sales of maritime security equipment to the country which has tangled with china over claims to islands in the south china sea but there are several factors that will likely prevent vietnam from buying more advanced offensive military equipment in the near future analysts say the first is the fact that some members of congress continue to have concerns about the country s human rights record and congress has a lot of say over foreign arms deals the second obstacle is that vietnam s military has a limited defense budget and likely can t afford the most advanced u s military equipment obama calls for peaceful

husbandâ at a rally last weekâ in atlantic city â ap photo mel evans mrs sanders has become an increasingly prominent figure in her husbandâ s campaign the onetime community activist routinely travels with him and has become a ubiquitous surrogate on cable tv the failure of burlington college gives credence to two arguments routinely made by the clinton campaign and its allies first bernie and jane were insufficiently vetted by the mainstream media many reporters have passed on writing up opposition research hits about the vermont senator or focusing on the problems at the college because they did not believe he ever had any realistic chance of being the nominee the clintons owing to their status as the front runners and former occupants of the white house have continued to command a more intense level of scrutiny the sanders campaign has ignored repeated requests for comment on burlington collegeâ s failure the uncharacteristic silence is telling the campus of burlington college in

donors and their advisers the free for all environment alarms theâ strategists who have signed on to helpâ trump â â the lack of a major super pac vehicle is a source of concern among top trump advisers some of whom have contacted experienced strategists in recent weeks to gauge their interest in launching a new entity such outreach is potentially risky since federal law prohibits a candidateâ s agent from establishing a super pac â â when asked if he was aware of such talks trump campaign manager corey lewandowski wrote in an email â mr trump continues to disavow all super pacâ

county unlike eight years ago when clinton lost the county to barack obama she could show unexpected strength against sanders in one of the stateâ s liberal enclaves â kentucky strategist dale emmons

for bloomberg on thursday suggesting that donald trump was starting to make economic sense i was glad to see trump address fed related issues in an interview with fortune magazine last week his key comments we have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country we have to rebuild our military which is being decimated by bad decisions we have to do a lot of things we have to reduce our debt and the best thing we have going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren t being done amazingly let us remember that in this same fortune interview trump said he would dump fed chair janet yellen and also criticized rates as too low and punishing savers he also did a full reversal from an interview given just a couple of weeks prior in which he pledged to wipe out the entire trillion national debt in eight years which would well it would be impossible then there is the matter of the trillion cost of his tax cut plan this is making sense aba slams fed on

window for tpp may not be open for all that long no question about that trump has castigated the deal and clinton after initially supporting it very strongly now says she opposes it clinton would take massive heat from labor unions and other core constituencies early in her presidency if she moved quickly on tpp the best scenario for clinton is for the lame duck to approve tpp so she wouldn t have

house correspondents dinner is supposed to be the hard wired epicenter of american politics an insider s ball where the shame of admitting you re the last to know something is a humiliation of carrie pig s blood prom magnitude yet everywhere at the roses and rolexes dinner you could hear squeals of collective ignorance and expressions of shock feigned and real how the hell did america let donald trump become the nominee of a major party it was only right and proper therefore that indiana the flyover state with the biggest shoulder chip about the coastal dopey elites should ratify trump s nomination as the gop populist standard bearer a week ago trump who had been languishing in the s and s on most primary nights finally did what a normal frontrunner was supposed to do consolidate his support into a solid majority hitting the s and s alas there will be no stop trump candidate not after his plus point win in indiana gone is the great transformation of unlikeable ted cruz from tea party arsonist to the establishment s friendly neighborhood fireman of last resort the whole damn thing just burned down cruz s hoosier firewall crumbled and his campaign folded but at least the texas senator didn t have to watch it by his lonesome he had his imaginary running mate carly fiorina there by his side sanders narrowly defeated clinton in indiana which matters not one little bit despite what the cable networks and his campaign will hype here are five takeaways from a tuesday that essentially sealed this fall s trump clinton showdown third party like it s once upon a time six months ago the animating spirit of the republican party and its affiliated oligarchs was a desire to destroy the political aspirations of hillary clinton trump s unexpected ascent has scrambled those priorities in ways that might have been unthinkable when jeb bush seemed on a glide path to the nomination charles koch whose family has spent untold millions battling clinton and other democrats mused that it was possible she would be a more palatable alternative than his fellow billionaire trump and longtime john mccain pal mark salter flat out threw his backing behind the former secretary of state on tuesday in a tweet most republicans can t or won t go that far in that case they would need an electoral half way house first floated by you guessed it the donald himself a third party candidate of the teddy roosevelt bull moose variety that allows them to oppose trump cast their votes for a vetted conservative of their liking and avoid the unacceptable fate of having to go the full hillary but the most compelling argument for not republican republican campaign is that it gives down ballot candidates a way out of running under the sequined trump banner to support a true conservative whatever that means the alternative has been floated for months nebraska sen ben sasse the first republican of stature to suggest the idea has been mentioned as a possible candidate as has former texas gov and two time presidential loser rick perry there are of course major hurdles to mounting a third party bid this late but expect talk of trump alternatives to grow there s already a counter campaign emerging urging the gop to take a one time hit in order to hasten a bright post donald future this from the wall street journal the battered bulletin of the party establishment better for republican leaders to navigate issue by issue around the trump black swan candidacy while demonstrating their own convictions and independence it ain t over til the hewlett packard lady sings mccain s selection of sarah palin as his running mate is seen in retrospect as his struggling campaign s self inflicting coup de grace as an act of damaging desperation cruz s selection of fiorina as his mythical vice presidential pick wasn t in the same league although the former computer executive s impromptu on camera outburst of song ranks as a singularly bizarre moment in a twin peaks campaign because cruz was probably doomed pre carly but it was weird not a good thing when the main meme about your candidate involves his resemblance to sketches of the zodiac killer moreover it reflected the prevailing sense of selective unicorn reality that descended over a campaign that was up to that point the most cannily run in either party jeff roe cruz s genial campaign manager has emerged as a star operative in a year of meh campaigning how does hillary buy off bernie no unnamed clinton staffer said this i did so stand down sanders fundraising team despite his narrow victory in the hoosier state sanders is more or less cooked as a viable presidential contender barring as must always be said with the clintons some unforeseen cataclysm mitch stewart one of the logistical wizards behind barack obama s landslide posited that the vermont senator would have to win something like to percent of the delegates to make a dent in clinton s insurmountable plus lead in pledged delegates he didn t but he d also committed to staying in through the convention his wife jane doubled down on that pledge early tuesday to maximize his leverage over the platform and to give clinton and her pet plutocrats some serious agita but what specific deliverables would be required to compel bernie s army to take up arms against trump earlier this year sanders top strategist tad devine suggested that clinton might consider the democratic socialist as her running mate a trial balloon the candidate himself quickly punctured people close to sanders and his ally in anti wall st spirit elizabeth warren tell me they want assurances clinton will appoint the right people to key treasury department and oversight agency posts sanders hasn t been talking about his terms of surrender yet at least that s the official line but he would clearly like to score a major policy shift from clinton his dream would be to make breaking up the big banks part of the democratic platform i ve been told but he ll almost certainly garner more widespread support in pushing campaign finance reform and structural changes to the primary process whatever it is he ll need assurances that it s not just a fig leaf but a real shift in the party s position said a top sanders ally not in the decision making chain of his campaign he s earned his place at the table donald duh trump has a stranglehold on about half of the to percent of white americans who vote in republican primaries the rest of the nation well he s still pissing lots of them off and the smarter political types in his orbit fret his unprecedentedly high disapproval ratings his longtime war consigliore roger stone likens trump to reagan but the candidate himself spent indiana week convincing the country he was don reckless trump continued his ill advised attack on clinton s use of the gender card which helped her anemic online fundraising operation clear a blockbuster million plus in a couple of days even though cruz was already headed to a campaign loss the donald decided to go all oliver stone on his father anti castro cuban immigrant raul i mean what was he doing what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death before the shooting trump continued it s horrible the clintons are terrified that trump who conspicuously lunched with their fact challenged biographer ed klein to preview the knee capping he intends to deliver this fall but his capacity to savage himself shouldn t be underestimated when will clinton release her goldman sachs transcript sanders often through the scowling personage of his tough guy campaign manager jeff weaver has continued to the very great chagrin of the clinton camp to hammer away at the issue of the frontrunner s lavishly compensated wall street speeches clinton has said to widespread ridicule that she ll release them once her foes do likewise with sanders campaign now testing the statistical outer limits of viability the pressure for clinton to dump them to reporters in an effort to cut off the challenge from the left has greatly diminished but trump looms and he s already signaled he ll continue sanders attacks in the general election as a way to question her character and her alleged slavishness to big money donors the news trough between the early june california primary and the late july convention in philly seems like a logical time to drop the presumably unflattering transcripts if she decides to release them at all to view online "

burgessev or beverett politico com rand is back like he never left i sat down with sen rand paul earlier this month with some expectation that he d be a bit different than the one who spent years building up a libertarian leaning profile that urged his party faithful to consider a different kind of republicanism that was not the case paul revels in addressing many of the same topics that brought him to prominence foreign aid the intelligence apparatus and avoiding military entanglements the only thing he wasn t really trying to discuss was the presidential race that he exited much earlier than he had hoped and he sounds quite wary of committing himself again to a national campaign it s hard to ask somebody who just spent a lot of effort being here and there and being everywhere in between about doing it again it s not something that i can immediately say oh my goodness i m looking forward to paul said even as he conceded that would be perfect for an ophthalmologist reassessing overseas it wasn t long after he returned to the senate full time that the chamber was voting on paul s proposal to block f sales to pakistan part of a liberal conservative alliance that the kentucky senator has clinched with sen chris murphy of connecticut it s classic rand paul as sen dan coats put it but paul s colleagues praise him for being forthright about his intentions and generally not surprising them with his stubborn demands for votes with sen roger wicker putting it best rand is genteel next he and murphy are eyeing a proposal that would require saudi arabia to hit certain terrorism fighting requirements to buy arms because as paul says it shouldfrom the cutting room floor i asked paul to explain his style a little bit which he often calls honey over vinegar i feel like i get along well with people people don t mind differences of agreement so much they mind if you question their motivation that s like calling you a liar or something calling you dishonest by questioning your motivation that becomes really personal is that why ted cruz s campaign can t get senate endorsements i guess i d rather just comment on mine in the sense of what i try to do a couple days later i asked if he had spoken to cruz recently paul wouldn t say biden goes hard for senate joe biden is in pennsylvania today likely to hit the trail a bit for establishment backed senate candidate katie mcginty evidence that the vice president s engaged heavily in making sure there s a democratic senate to preserve his and president barack obama s legacy in biden pushed for a joint endorsement of mcginty with the president edward isaac dovere reports and sen chuck schumer looks at biden as the democrats point guy it s part frustration with years of the administration s troubles with senate republicans exacerbated by their refusal to move on supreme court nominee merrick garland and holding up the biden rule as defense part sales job reinforcing the obama biden

serious conservative with a friendly demeanor who totes budget charts to town halls and is more prone to a back slap than a back stab but in the last year donald trump has seized control of the republican party throwing verbal daggers in every direction and offering little in terms of policy specifics as he waltzed through the gop presidential primary n ow ryan is having to contend with a reality trump is the party s nominee and there is nothing he can do about it so here s the house speaker s play according to multiple people in ryan s inner circle he wants trump to understand where he is coming from ryan wants to try to steer the party s national political dialogue as embodied by trump s barbed rhetoric in a better direction he wants an open line of communication between his operation and trump s he isn t going to try to extract policy concessions from trump he understands they are unlikely to ever agree on trade or immigration but he wants some recognition that ryan has

just that as well as house rules changes gop to trump more scotus info please your huddle author some of donald trump s toughest gop critics in the senate are pressuring the presumptive republican nominee to reveal more information about the type of justices he would nominate for the supreme court and force the mercurial candidate to bolster his conservative bona fides we re going to decide at

sandersbernie sanders capped off a day of campaigning around indiana on monday with a boisterous and energetic rally in downtown indianapolis mr sanders s voice sounded particularly hoarse as he railed against income inequality with many of his supporters reciting parts of his now familiar speech along with him the rally was one of three he held in indiana on monday to court the state s voters who go to the polls on tuesday and stress the state s importance in his push to win the democratic presidential nomination although the chances have narrowed for the vermont senator his supporters were as lively as ever on monday night shouting his name and waving signs throughout his speech republican party candidatested cruzted cruz has everything he wanted in indiana a one on one match up with rival donald trump in a conservative state with a supportive governor and an announced running mate carly fiorina at his side but on monday cruz is racing to reverse polls that showed him trailing i trust the people of indiana to differentiate we are not a bitter angry petty bigoted people that is not america i reject that vision of america cruz said in osceola we are not an angry ugly people and the people of indiana the people of indiana have good judgment have good values the people of indiana are the heartland of this country and we have a choice we have a choice about our national character who we will be john kasichif things go as forecast in today s indiana primary the pressure on john kasich to give up his presidential dream is likely to increase dramatically that s because donald trump will have all but sewn up a victory before july s gop convention in cleveland turning the governor s quest from long shot to all but impossible if trump sweeps the hoosier state he would have to win only about percent of the delegates in the handful of remaining states to attain the needed to mathematically clinch the nomination if we win indiana it s over trump proclaimed donald trumpit s primary day in indiana all polls close by p m eastern where ted cruz s best hope is to keep donald trump from delegates and force a contested convention but things are not looking up for cruz who is finding that barnstorming the state picking a veep and millions in television ads aren t enough to overcome the distaste with which he is viewed by many in the gop he d even scored the support of establishment figures and convinced his rival john kasich to clear the field in the state for years cruz has argued that his absolutist strain of conservatism would win if only given a chance and for months he has promised victory over trump in a head to head match up both of those hypotheses will be tested to and likely to be proven false for cruz it will be a crumbling of the myth he helped create of a silent crop of millions of conservatives who have stayed home in recent elections just waiting for a savior like him to turn them out to the polls for trump a win won t put him

with clinton struggling to sew up the democratic nomination against a socialist septuagenarian â sheâ s expected to lose tomorrowâ s kentucky primary â we cannot foreclose the possibility that she will botch the fall campaign against the billionaire businessman complacency unforced errorswhen hillary goes off her carefully scripted message she has a tendency to gaffe one reason she is expected to lose kentucky tomorrow is her declaration at a town hall this spring that â weâ re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business â hillary clinton we are going to put a lot of coal miners amp coal companies out of business and there was the time clinton incensed the gay community by praising the reagans for starting â a national conversationâ about hiv aids prompting a quick retraction not inspiringclinton cannot just make this election a referendum on trumpism she must outline a compelling vision for where she wants to take the country to fully activate the coalition that powered barack obama â i am not a natural politician in case you haven t noticed like my husband or president obama clinton said at the postâ s debate in march the presumptive

pollster who has conducted a series of focus groups for the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania hart said this is â about the lowest barâ for a candidate and yet clinton has lower likability numbers today than she did when the campaign began moving too far to the rightshe needs sanders supporters to unite behind her if it looks like sheâ s shifting rightward to win votes she will look inauthentic and many bernie people will stay on the sidelines sanders supporters dance for him at a rally in salem oregon â rob kerr afp getty images moving too far to the leftclinton has treated sanders with kid gloves recently she wants him and his people to fall in line after the july convention in philadelphia and she calculates that antagonizing him is not worth sewing up the nomination earlier but if hillary continues to lurch leftward to satisfy the bernie people it will be harder to win those in the middle and woo disaffected republicans you might think

responding to every insult and attack it leads to more repetition of the original charge and keeps it in the news hillary dislikes the media her impulse is to keep the press away to only give the appearance of access and to focus her attention on friendly outlets that will engage in puffery trump to his credit talks to basically everyone it gets him in trouble like when he told chris matthews
